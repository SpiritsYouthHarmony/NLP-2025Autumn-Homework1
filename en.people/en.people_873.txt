158th joint patrol of Mekong River begins - People's Daily Online KUNMING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement authorities from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand on Tuesday launched their 158th joint Mekong River patrol mission to combat cross-border crime. On Tuesday morning, three Chinese law enforcement vessels and three Laotian vessels departed from the Jingha port in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of southwest China's Yunnan Province, signaling the start of the coordinated mission. Two law enforcement vessels from Myanmar are also involved in the patrol. The mission will target cross-border crimes such as online gambling, telecom fraud, and drug production and trafficking, with the aim of maintaining the safety of the waterway. Ahead of the mission, law enforcement authorities from the four countries held a joint commanders' meeting and an information exchange session in Jinghong City, Xishuangbanna, to assess the latest security situation and cross-border crime trends along the Mekong River, and to discuss coordinated measures to strengthen regional security. The three Laotian vessels participating in the 158th joint patrol arrived in Xishuangbanna on Sept. 30 for a friendly visit to the water patrol division of the Yunnan provincial public security department. During the visit, the two sides deepened their cooperation by exchanging views on training, law enforcement capacity-building and cultural exchange. The Mekong River -- known as the Lancang River in China -- is a vital waterway for cross-border shipping. China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand have been conducting joint patrols of the river since December 2011.
