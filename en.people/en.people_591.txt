Flowers Bloom in China - People's Daily Online Flowers bloom in China, countless blossoms unfolding, as more and more women create infinite splendor with resilience and passion in their own fields. Lu Shengmei safeguards lives with her medical skills, Zhang Guimei brings hope through education. Like two "red plum blossoms" rooted in the north and south of China, their hearts always devoted to the sun; Tu Youyou devoted herself to studying artemisinin, turning a humble herb into a life-saving medicine. Wang Yaping, China's first "teacher in space," conducted the "Tiangong Class" three times, quietly sowing seeds of space dreams. Each woman is the heroine of her own story; every woman radiates her own glow. (Intern Yu Yiran contributed to this story. )
