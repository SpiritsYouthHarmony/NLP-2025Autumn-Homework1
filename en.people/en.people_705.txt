The mountains will remember me - Inheriting the spirit of the Red Flag Canal engineering marvel - People's Daily Online As visitors from far and wide flock to witness the marvels of the Red Flag Canal in Linzhou, Anyang, central China's Henan Province, they are reminded of the extraordinary achievements that can be accomplished through unity and perseverance. With bare hands, local villagers carved out a 1,500-kilometer canal along the steep crags of Taihang Mountain in the 1960s. Within a decade, they brought precious water from the Zhanghe River in bordering Shanxi Province to Anyang's then drought-stricken area, Linxian county, now known as Linzhou.
