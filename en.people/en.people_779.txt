Australian statement attempts to cover up military aircraft’s illegal intrusion into China’s territorial airspace: MOD - People's Daily Online In response to Australian Defense Ministry's recent statement claiming that an Australian military P-8A patrol aircraft conducting a patrol in the South China Sea experienced an "unsafe and unprofessional interaction" with Chinese military aircraft on Sunday, Jiang Bin, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said on Wednesday that the Australian statement confounded right and wrong and misplaced the blame to the Chinese side, attempting to cover up its serious misconduct of sending a military aircraft to illegally intrude into China's territorial airspace. "We express strong dissatisfaction with this and have made stern representations to the Australian side," he said. The troops of the PLA Southern Theater Command organized forces to resolutely stop and expel the Australian military aircraft that intruded China's territorial airspace over Xisha. The relevant operations are lawful, professional, up to standard and restrained. Australia made infringements and provocations against China, but falsely accused China's legitimate rights-protecting actions as "unsafe" and "unprofessional." Such fallacy finds no market anywhere, Jiang said. "We urge Australia to immediately stop infringement and provocation and stop hyping up the matter, and strictly restrain its maritime and air force military operations to avoid undermining the bilateral relations and military relations between the two countries," Jiang said, noting that the Chinese military will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and security and firmly uphold peace and stability in the region.
