Shenzhen's Nanshan drives AI revolution - People's Daily Online On Sept. 18, 2025, People's Daily Online reporters visited the “Model Camp” AI Ecosystem Community in Shenzhen's Nanshan district, south China's Guangdong Province, to experience the entrepreneurial wave of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Thanks to Shenzhen's firm industrial foundation in computer and algorithm models and its advantages in talent acquisition, the community has attracted a number of high-tech enterprises from across the country. 142 enterprises have been selected to settle in the community, benefiting from the infrastructure, preferential policies, and high-quality services it offers. Among these chosen companies, there are not only AI large-model organizations set up by scholars from the University of Cambridge, but also companies specializing in embodied intelligence that Chinese top universities and institutions have nurtured. Supported by the community, the AI industry in the Nanshan district is poised to lead the field's domestic innovation and exert significant influence in the modern-day industrial revolution.
