Enchanting autumn scenery in Suihua, NE China's Heilongjiang - People's Daily Online In Suihua city, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, fields, riversides, lakeshores and hillsides combine to form a painter's palette, revealing the enchanting autumn scenery. At a threshing ground in Suihua's Beilin district, golden corn kernels spread evenly across the ground glisten under the sunlight, capturing the abundance of harvest time. In rural Hailun, a county-level city under Suihua, a winding river flows between banks lined with trees displaying shades of red, yellow, orange and green — a natural canvas alive with color. In Wangkui county, a tranquil lake rests at the foot of Miaoshan Mountain. As dusk falls, willows along the shore glow with a warm amber hue, their branches swaying gracefully in the fading light to form a serene and inviting autumn scene. In the rice fields of Zhaodong, another county-level city in Suihua, waves of golden grain ripple gently in the breeze. Pink garden cosmoses bloom along the ridges, their soft hues blending with the golden fields to create a vivid autumn tableau. Along the Hulan River and its nearby reservoir, grasses glow a brilliant red, framing the clear waters with striking bands of crimson.
