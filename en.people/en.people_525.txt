South African Communist Party leader: China a model for fair global cooperation - People's Daily Online Solly Mapaila, general secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), receives interview with People's Daily Online South Africa. (People's Daily Online/Liu Chang） Solly Mapaila, general secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), has lauded China's role in global development and its growing partnership with South Africa, calling it a model for equitable cooperation and shared progress. In an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online South Africa, Mapaila reflected on China's modernization journey, the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and the opportunities for deeper collaboration in infrastructure, industrialization, and rural development. "Every time you visit Beijing, you can see visible progress," he said. "It's remarkable how the CPC and the Chinese government have managed to balance modernity and history, building a modern capital while preserving the soul of their culture." Supporting global governance and multipolarity Mapaila expressed strong support for President Xi Jinping's Global Governance Initiative (GGI), describing it as a visionary framework that champions fairness, equality, and respect for sovereignty in the international system. "We must thank President Xi Jinping and the CPC for their foresight," he said. "The GGI promotes a multipolar world that values equality among nations. It's the kind of leadership the world urgently needs." Mapaila added that China's major initiatives, like the GGI and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), offer developing nations practical tools for progress. "These initiatives give countries a real chance to chart their own development paths," he explained. "They strengthen rather than dominate. That's what makes them so important." Building tangible cooperation While political ties between China and South Africa are solid, Mapaila believes the next phase of the partnership must focus more on tangible economic outcomes. "China has achieved phenomenal development, not just at home but across the world," he noted. "South Africa offers immense potential for mutual benefit, particularly in infrastructure. China is known for building world-class ports, railways, and roads, there's no reason we shouldn't aim for the same here." Although China remains South Africa's largest trading partner, Mapaila emphasized that collaboration in areas like industrialization, technology transfer, and public infrastructure still has room to grow. Lessons from China's development Reflecting on China's success in lifting over 800 million people out of poverty, Mapaila said Africa has much to learn from China's approach to inclusive growth and state-led industrialization. He added that China has proven what can be achieved when the state plays an active role in driving development and eradicating poverty. A partnership of equals For Mapaila, the China-South Africa relationship stands out for its foundation of respect and mutual understanding. "China doesn't treat us as subordinates," he said. "They engage with us as equals, as friends and comrades. That's what makes this partnership fundamentally different from our historical relations with the West." He further praised China's leadership role within BRICS, particularly its push for trade in local currencies and reform of global institutions. China's influence in BRICS gives the Global South a stronger voice and helps shape a fairer international order, he said. Summing up his vision, Mapaila said the partnership between China and South Africa is built on shared values, equality, solidarity, and a commitment to human progress. Mapaila emphasized that the idea of building a community with a shared future for mankind serves as a reminder of humanity's collective responsibility. It envisions a world where development benefits all people rather than a privileged few. Through its cooperation with China, South Africa has the opportunity to strengthen its economy, empower its citizens, and contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable global order.
