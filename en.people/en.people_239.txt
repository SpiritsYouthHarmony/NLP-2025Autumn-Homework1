Working together for enduring peace, stability - People's Daily Online A stable international order is the cornerstone of global peace and development. At the recently concluded 12th Beijing Xiangshan Forum, representatives from more than 100 countries, regions, and international organizations, along with experts, scholars, and observers, convened under the theme "Upholding International Order and Promoting Peaceful Development." The forum addressed pressing global security challenges and explored cooperative approaches to safeguard the international order and bridge security deficits. "When China held its grand military parade on Sept. 3, I was in Senegal. The event was widely covered, even across Africa. It reminded people of China's significant contribution to the victory in the World Anti-Fascist War," said Harold E. Raugh, Jr., president of the International Commission of Military History. Many international participants echoed this sentiment, referencing China's recent commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. Their remarks reflected deep respect for China's longstanding commitment to global peace and development. Commemorating this historic victory serves not only as a tribute to the past but also as a call to learn from history in pursuit of a better future. Eight decades ago, a new international order emerged from the devastation of war, founded on humanity's collective aspirations for peace and justice. Over the past eight decades, the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter have contributed significantly to preserving global peace and advancing human progress. However, today this postwar order faces mounting challenges. Power politics, unilateralism, and coercive practices are undermining established norms, threatening the foundations of global stability and running counter to the currents of history. In turbulent times, the need for leadership, dialogue, and cooperation becomes even more urgent. China's recently proposed Global Governance Initiative rests on five core concepts: adhering to sovereign equality, abiding by the international rule of law, practicing multilateralism, advocating a people-centered approach, and focusing on taking real actions. In full alignment with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the initiative offers a timely and pragmatic approach to preserving the international order. At the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, many participants recognized the initiative as an important platform for international cooperation that will address common challenges and strengthen the foundation for global security. They praised its emphasis on sovereign equality, its foundation in the UN system, and its alignment with the aspirations of the Global South for a more inclusive, just, and equitable world order. Openness and inclusiveness were defining features of this year's forum. Participants included representatives not only from developed and emerging major countries, but also from small and medium-sized states and conflict-affected regions. Amid widening global security divides, this diversity underscored the forum's value as a platform for inclusive dialogue. It reflected China's vision of resolving differences through consultation and addressing disputes through cooperation. As some international media outlets observed, the Beijing Xiangshan Forum has provided Global South countries with a platform where their voices are heard, broadening global discourse beyond Western-dominated venues. China's role in global security governance has become increasingly prominent in recent years. The 2025 Conference of Global Public Security Cooperation Forum, held in recent days, drew participants from 120 countries, regions, and international organizations to engage in discussions on global security issues. From putting forward the Global Security Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative to launching dialogue platforms such as the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, the China-Africa Peace and Security Forum, the Middle East Security Forum, and the China-Latin America High-Level Defense Forum, China has consistently taken concrete steps to advance peace and stability. Its active participation in UN peacekeeping missions and mediation in regional conflicts further demonstrates its growing role as a responsible global actor. Humanity shares a common future. Only by treating each other as equals, coexisting in harmony, and fostering mutual support can nations eliminate the root causes of war and achieve lasting peace and stability. Looking ahead, China will continue working hand in hand with the international community to promote cooperation and safeguard peace, injecting greater stability into the turbulent world and creating new hope for the future of humanity.
