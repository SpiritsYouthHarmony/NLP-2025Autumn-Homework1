Beauty of Seasons: White Dew - People's Daily Online Hi, everyone! I'm Sisi, a travel enthusiast. Today we welcome Bailu, or White Dew, the third solar term of autumn. Come with me to Suzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province, and feel the deepening charm of autumn. During White Dew, the summer heat gradually fades, and the weather turns cooler. With greater differences between day and night temperatures, moisture in the air condenses into dewdrops—hence the name "White Dew." In ancient times, people divided the 15 days of White Dew into three phases: "First, wild geese arrive; second, swallows return south; third, birds begin to store food." Migratory birds are highly sensitive to temperature changes, and the ancient Chinese observed that by White Dew, geese, swallows, and other species start their southward journey in search of warmer lands, while many birds begin storing food for the winter. Around this time, the Northern Hemisphere enters the peak of bird migration. The Taihu Lake area in Suzhou, recognized as an internationally important wetland along the East Asia–Australasia migratory route, truly lives up to its name as a "paradise for migratory birds." Flocks travel southward along major flyways, crossing continents to overwinter in warmer regions. To safeguard these ecosystems, China has enacted a Wetland Conservation Law, strengthening the conservation of 82 internationally significant wetlands and protecting habitats for migratory birds—an important contribution to global biodiversity. Customs of White Dew mostly revolve around the idea of "nourishing with dew," a practice rooted in agrarian society. Ancient people believed that with the weather turning cooler, the body was more prone to dryness, or "autumn dryness." To counter this, they consumed nourishing foods such as longans and tremella mushrooms. This tradition continues today, reflecting the harmonious relationship between humans and nature. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there is also a custom of brewing and sharing "Bailu Rice Wine" during this season. With a mellow warmth and a hint of sweetness, it carries with it the hospitality of autumn. "As of tonight, the dew turns white; the moon shines brighter over my hometown." May your steps never cease, and may you embrace autumn with a fresh spirit and reap joy along the way! (Zhang Jiatong, as an intern, also contributed to this article.)
