Yiwu Global Digital Trade Center opens with AI-driven innovation - People's Daily Online The Yiwu Global Digital Trade Center, described as Yiwu's sixth-generation marketplace, officially opened on Oct. 14, attracting buyers worldwide to the city in east China's Zhejiang Province known as the "world's supermarket." In the jewelry section of the center, a shop called "Tang Tang Tang" has become a popular stop for visitors. At the center of the store, a computer draws lines of customers eager to try out an artificial intelligence-powered bracelet design platform. In 2023, shop owner Huang Zixuan and his partners launched an AI design platform. "With AI-generated renderings, clients can confirm designs without producing physical samples. This cuts production time by more than half and reduces material waste by about 30 percent," Huang said. Huang Zixuan showcases AI-generated bracelet pictures.

Once a designer completes a product design, the system can automatically match it with the most suitable manufacturer and generate a price quote, streamlining production and improving resource allocation.

"My parents have been running a jewelry business in Yiwu for more than 20 years, so I practically grew up in the market," she said. "When I learned a new market was opening, I decided it was time to take over the family business."
