Each mu (about 0.07 hectares) of chili peppers now yields a net profit of around 7,000 yuan (about $981), up 1,000 yuan from previous scattered cultivation methods.

Party members, officials and technical staff work directly in the fields, providing support from seed selection to pest control. Village collectives sign purchase agreements with enterprises, ensuring stable production and secure sales for higher farmer incomes. "This year, chili pepper cultivation in our town covers about 5,000 mu, with expected dried chili yields exceeding 350 kilograms per mu," said Xu Hongkun, Party chief of Taomiao town. Xu added that the contract farming model secures reliable orders and guaranteed purchases, eliminating farmers' sales worries while providing companies with quality raw materials. Countywide, chili pepper cultivation covers 250,000 mu, producing more than 100,000 tonnes of dried chilies annually. The transition from scattered farming to large-scale, standardized production has made chili peppers a key industry for increasing local incomes.
