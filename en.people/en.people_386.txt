At a welcome dinner hosted by friendly organizations in the US in November 2023, President Xi proposed that China was ready to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to increase interactions between the two peoples, especially between the youth. Xiong Sihao, vice-minister of education, said at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office that more than 36,000 American young people have been inspired by the president's call and come to China for exchanges over the past two years. For example, a US youth pickleball cultural exchange delegation from Maryland had forged unforgettable friendships with Chinese youths during the trip to China in April, Xiong added.
