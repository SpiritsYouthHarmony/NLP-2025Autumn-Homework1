Trending in China | The art of guqin making - People's Daily Online A millennia-old Chinese string instrument, the guqin gained global recognition in 2003 when UNESCO inscribed it on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Today's guqin makers continue to follow time-honored methods, selecting the finest materials and using techniques passed down through generations. They carve the wood, apply layers of lacquer and attach the strings with patience and precision. As the instrument ages, its sound deepens, carrying not only melodies but also the essence of Eastern culture and wisdom. (Produced by Kang Yutong and Wu Shuyi; Source: Kuaishou)
