Protecting green mountains and clear waters in Nyingchi: Xizang's 'Jiangnan on the Snowy Plateau' - People's Daily Online Ecology ranks among the highest priorities in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region. Yani National Wetland Park, a vibrant ecological haven, is nurtured at the confluence of the Nyang River and the Yarlung Zangbo River. Medog, a county nestled in the middle and lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and boasting extraordinary biodiversity, is hailed as a "biological gene bank of the world". To protect the Earth's Third Pole, ecological guardians on the snow-covered plateau are constantly uncovering ecological codes. They traverse every stretch of land on foot, writing Xizang's story of harmony between humans and nature.
