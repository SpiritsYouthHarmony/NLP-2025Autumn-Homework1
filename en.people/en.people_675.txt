A Sui Stele at Longxing Temple: President Xi's 40-year commitment to cultural heritage - People's Daily Online On May 19, 2025, while inspecting the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, central China's Henan Province, Chinese President Xi Jinping recalled an experience from his earlier days working in Zhengding, north China's Hebei Province. During a visit to Longxing Temple, he noticed a Sui Dynasty stele that had suffered severe deterioration over time. He immediately called for protective measures, and the stele was subsequently confirmed to be an important relic of calligraphy. In 1984, Xi published an article in China Youth magazine introducing Zhengding county, where he again underscored the remarkable value of the stele. From his call for protection and written reflections on the stele four decades ago to his recollections at the Longmen Grottoes in 2025, Xi’s enduring concern demonstrates his unwavering commitment to the preservation of cultural heritage.
