Beauty of Seasons: Cold Dew - People's Daily Online Hi, everyone! I'm Sisi, a travel enthusiast. When the morning dew carries a hint of chill and the maple leaves on the branches turn crimson, we welcome Hanlu, or Cold Dew, the fifth solar term of autumn. Right now, I'm in Huangshan city, east China's Anhui Province. Come along with me and experience the serene yet vibrant beauty of this season, when "the dew grows cold, almost ready to freeze." With the arrival of "Han" (cold), the last traces of summer heat are gone and the Cold Dew solar term is a clear signal of the seasonal shift toward chillier days. According to ancient Chinese observations, the period of Cold Dew is divided into "three phases:" First, wild geese arrive as honored guests—the final flocks complete their migration southward, as if keeping an appointment; second, sparrows disappear, imagined by the ancients to transform into clams buried in the sand—a poetic way of interpreting nature; and third, chrysanthemums burst into golden bloom, becoming the most dazzling sight of the season. In the Huangshan Mountains, Cold Dew paints a particularly enchanting scene. At dawn, seas of clouds weave around its peaks, pine branches sparkle with crystal-like droplets of dew, and fiery red maples blaze against the gray stone cliffs. Down in the villages at the foot of the mountains, golden corn and bright red chilies hang drying from eaves, while the fragrance of chrysanthemums mingles with the smoke of village hearths—warming the crisp autumn air. On the other side of the world, autumn also carries its unique charm. In rural France, it's chestnut harvest season, with villagers carrying wicker baskets to gather fallen chestnuts. In Canada, pumpkin season is drawing to a close—farms pile up pumpkins like little hills, where people pick their favorites to carve into lanterns or bake into pies, filling the streets with a sweet, comforting aroma. I pick fenceside asters at will; Carefree I see the southern hill. Cold Dew embodies the depth of autumn, holding both the grandeur of nature and the warmth of daily life. What does Cold Dew look like where you are? Is it the smell of roasted sweet potatoes on the street, or the rustling of fallen leaves outside your window? Share your Cold Dew stories with us!
