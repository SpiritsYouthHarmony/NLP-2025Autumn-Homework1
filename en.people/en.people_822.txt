China firmly opposes British sanctions targeting Chinese enterprises under "Russia-related" pretext - People's Daily Online BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China has voiced firm opposition to the UK's decision to include 11 Chinese enterprises in its sanctions under the pretext of so-called "Russia-related" issues, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said Monday. In response to a media query, the spokesperson said that normal exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and Russian companies should not be disrupted or affected. The UK's move constitutes a unilateral sanction that lacks basis in international law or the authorization of the United Nations, the spokesperson said. China urges the UK to immediately correct its erroneous action and revoke the sanctions against the Chinese enterprises, the spokesperson said, adding that it will take necessary measures to firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.
