Under the project, China provided 3.5 million U.S. dollars to help Zambia purchase approximately 5,641 metric tonnes of maize locally. The grain will be distributed over three months to 188,057 beneficiaries, or around 37,000 households, in the most drought-affected districts of Southern and Western Provinces.

In his remarks, Han said the food assistance program strengthens the comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership between China and Zambia, highlighting the enduring friendship forged by their founding leaders and nurtured by successive generations. Han highlighted that the program, jointly implemented by China, Zambia, and the WFP, represents a new model of partnership that integrates bilateral assistance into a broader multilateral framework, showcasing China's proactive and constructive role within the United Nations system. According to Han, the fund has supported over 190 projects in more than 60 countries in collaboration with more than 20 international organizations, benefiting over 30 million people worldwide in areas including food security, healthcare, maternal and child health, and vocational training. He emphasized that China will continue to mobilize resources through multiple channels to support Zambia's development, citing numerous instances of timely aid in recent years. On her part, Nalumango expressed gratitude to China for its timely and impactful support, noting that continued assistance across various sectors reflects the mutual and cordial relationship between the two countries.

She praised the project as a collaborative effort promoting sustainable outcomes and advancing shared commitments.
