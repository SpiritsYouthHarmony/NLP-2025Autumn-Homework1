Beauty of Seasons: Beginning of Autumn - People's Daily Online Hi, everyone. I'm Sisi, a travel enthusiast. Today marks the Beginning of Autumn, or Liqiu, the first solar term of the autumn season. Follow me to explore the first signs of the coming season in Chengde city, north China's Hebei Province. The "Li" in Liqiu means "beginning," while "Qiu" refers to the ripening of grains. After the Beginning of Autumn solar term, the summer heat begins to give way to the refreshing coolness of autumn, signaling the transition from growth to maturity in nature. Since ancient times, the Beginning of Autumn solar term has marked a key moment in agricultural society, symbolizing the approach of the harvest season. At this time of year, a stroll through the Chengde Mountain Resort reveals towering oil pines with dark green needles set against a clear blue sky. Their growth rings quietly record the cycles of the 24 solar terms. Pine cones hang silently from the branches, and the scent of resin drifts gently on the breeze. Within the cracked bark lies not only the resin that will help the trees withstand the coming winter, but also the enduring spirit of craftsmanship that likens pine to virtue. Liqiu signals the approaching fall, yet in many parts of China, the heat still lingers in the grip of the hottest days of summer—known as Sanfu. This lingering heat, fierce and relentless like a tiger, gives rise to the saying "Autumn Tiger" (Qiulaohu). In this sense, Liqiu is more of a symbolic beginning, a declaration of intent, rather than an immediate change. As the saying goes: "Autumn has begun, but the heat has not yet faded." Many traditions of Liqiu revolve around eating, such as "fleshing out in autumn" (Tie Qiu Biao) and "chew autumn" (Ken Qiu). "Fleshing out in autumn" involves eating meat to replenish energy lost during the scorching summer months. "Chew autumn" refers to eating watermelon on the day of Liqiu. The act of "chewing" symbolizes the desire to chew through the last of the summer heat and welcome the coolness of autumn. Around the same time, Turkmenistan celebrates its annual Melon Festival. People gather to taste and showcase sweet, juicy melons and watermelons, giving thanks for the earth's bounty and celebrating the season of harvest. Much like the Chinese Liqiu customs, this festival reflects a shared reverence for the transitions of seasons and a universal longing for abundance and well-being. "After fresh rain in mountains bare, autumn permeates evening air." No matter where you are, may this gentle coolness and quiet peace cross borders and find its way to you.
