Apron weaving tradition thrives in SW China's Xizang - People's Daily Online (Photo/People's Daily Online) National role model worker Tenzin Drolkar weaves traditional aprons at her loom at an apron cooperative in Jedeshol town, Gonggar county, Shannan city, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region. As colorful threads fly, a Tibetan apron known as "Bangdian" takes shape beneath her skilled hands. Bangdian is a bright, elegant traditional apron and an essential part of Tibetan women's attire. In 2006, the weaving technique was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage in China. (Photo/People's Daily Online) At the cooperative, women first spin wool into yarn. Next, they use traditional rock and plant-based dyes to color the yarn, producing vivid, long-lasting colors in more than 20 shades. Besides dyeing, making Bangdian involves repeated starching, kneading and drying to set the color, improve durability and make the fabric softer and smoother. After this detailed process, a Bangdian apron is complete. (Photo/People's Daily Online) The cooperative's exhibition hall displays Bangdian aprons and related products. Tenzin Drolkar has developed new products featuring Bangdian patterns and colors, such as carpets, cushions and phone cases, now exported to more than 10 countries. Her efforts have helped the cooperative launch training classes in Bangdian weaving, pulu fabric making, Tibetan carpet weaving and other handicrafts. More than 300 people have been trained, creating jobs for over 90 and allowing women to earn an income without leaving home.
