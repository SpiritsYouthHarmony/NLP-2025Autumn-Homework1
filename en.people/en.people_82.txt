Leather embroidery creates jobs, increases incomes for women in NW China's Qinghai - People's Daily Online Danga'er leather embroidery is a distinctive folk craft from Huangyuan county, northwest China's Qinghai Province. Unlike embroidery on silk, Danga'er leather embroidery uses specially prepared leather as its base, with threads made from wool, leather, horsehair, silk, velvet, and cotton in a variety of colors. Today, Huangyuan county has launched the "Danga'er Leather Embroidery" brand, creating new employment opportunities and increasing incomes for local women.
