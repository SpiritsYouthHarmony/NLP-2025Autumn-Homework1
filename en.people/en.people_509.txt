Former Iranian MP: China is shaping a new form of human civilization - People's Daily Online Speaking to a People's Daily correspondent in Iran, former Iranian MP Dr. Nasser Al-Sudani said that the new form of human civilization is the result of the formation and development of Chinese civilization and Chinese culture. Chinese civilization, with roots stretching back more than 5,000 years, is a unique model in human history in terms of its cultural continuity and ever-changing creativity. Al-Sudani, the president of Amir al-Mu'minin University in Ahvaz province, believes that the reason Chinese civilization has been able to remain so influential and far-reaching throughout the ages lies in its possession of a high-level cultural design, a solid value system, and deep-rooted intellectual traditions. The core values ​​of the Chinese people, such as harmony, moderation, coexistence, and mutual respect, are the pillars upon which this civilization is built, and they have preserved its vitality and effectiveness over time. Al-Sudani added, "Mutual learning among world civilizations is one of the most prominent features of Chinese civilization. China's historical experience demonstrates that cultural interaction and cultural rapprochement can contribute to the shared development of all nations. This vision resonates today in China's cultural and global policies." He continued, "As for the 'new form of human civilization' being presented today in Chinese cultural discourse, it is the fruit of balanced and harmonious development in various areas of human life. This new form of civilization is based on comprehensive progress in the material, political, spiritual, social, and environmental aspects, and presents a model for sustainable and humane development that is not limited to economic growth alone, but rather pays special attention to the balance between humanity, society, and nature." The former parliamentarian considered that, in the context of this progress, the governance philosophy pursued by the Communist Party of China played a fundamental role in shaping this path. The country's major policies have remained based on the principles of innovation, social justice, balanced growth, and national stability. This intellectual and institutional system has enabled China to achieve simultaneous material and spiritual development and enter a new phase of comprehensive development. Al-Sudani added, "Alongside these factors, science and technology constitute the primary driving force behind the new Chinese civilization, and thus the new form of human civilization as a whole. Today's scientific and technological innovations are shaping the contours of modern civilization." Al-Sudani detailed how the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) also plays a role in this new form civilization, saying "The Belt and Road Initiative is as much a cultural and civilizational initiative as it is an economic one. It is a continuation of the historical legacy of the ancient Silk Road, which for centuries has connected the peoples of Asia, Europe, and Africa through trade, science, and culture." From a cultural perspective, the BRI embodies the spirit of Chinese civilization, which has always emphasized interaction and peaceful coexistence. He explained that Chinese civilizational achievements have been transmitted to the Islamic world and contributed to its renaissance and accelerated development. Among the most prominent of these contributions are the papermaking and printing industries, which brought about a scientific and cultural revolution in Islamic countries. Chinese arts, such as painting and handicrafts, also influenced Muslim artists during the Middle Ages. These cultural and technical exchanges between China and the Islamic world were a living example of the creative interaction between civilizations and evidence of China's pivotal role in the development of human civilization. Al-Sudani concluded, "Chinese civilization has not only been vital and enduring within itself, but has also played an intermediary and inspiring role in human history. In today's world, which needs dialogue and rapprochement more than ever, China's historical and cultural experience can offer an inspiring example for a future based on peace, cooperation, and shared progress."
