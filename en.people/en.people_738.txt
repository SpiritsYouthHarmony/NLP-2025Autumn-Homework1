Nell Chennault Calloway: Carrying forward the spirit of the Flying Tigers - People's Daily Online (Photo provided by Meadows Robins) "It was a beautiful and powerful moment. Watching the doves soar into the sky was deeply symbolic—it reminded me of the universal desire for peace," said Nell Chennault Calloway, granddaughter of U.S. General Claire Lee Chennault, and director of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum. The Flying Tigers, officially known as the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force, was formed in 1941 by Chennault to help China in its fight against invading Japanese forces. More than 80 years later, this shared history remains deeply remembered by the peoples of both nations. Calloway was recently invited to China to attend the grand gathering commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War. This marked her second time attending a ceremony on the Tian'anmen Rostrum. A decade earlier, she had participated in the commemoration of the 70th anniversary. Returning to the ceremony this time, she felt deeply moved. "The scale, precision, and symbolism of the event were striking," she said. She was especially moved when she saw the modern equipment on display, which reminded her that her grandfather once wrote in his book that the Chinese Air Force had only 91 flyable airplanes in 1937. Recalling the history General Chennault personally experienced, Calloway said, "I don't think he would have been surprised by how far China has come. He always believed in the strength, resilience, and potential of the Chinese people. That message is universal, and it continues to resonate across generations and borders." For Calloway, the commemoration is not only about looking back at history, but also about looking toward the future. "We have a responsibility to ensure that the truth is preserved and that the values they stood for—courage, sacrifice, unity, and resilience—are passed down to future generations," she said.
