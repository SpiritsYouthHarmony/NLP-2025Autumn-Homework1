Chinese defense ministry says expelling Australian military aircraft justified, lawful - People's Daily Online BEIJING, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese defense ministry spokesperson on Wednesday said recent actions by the Chinese military to expel an Australian P-8A military aircraft from China's territorial airspace were justified, lawful, professional, and restrained, noting that the Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the Australian side. Jiang Bin, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, made the statement in response to a media inquiry about the recent incident and about the comments from the Australian side. The Southern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Sunday expelled an Australian P-8A military aircraft that, without the approval of the Chinese government, illegally intruded into China's territorial airspace over the Xisha Qundao. The theater command organized naval and air forces to conduct tracking and surveillance, take strong countermeasures, and issue warnings to drive the Australian aircraft away in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. The Australian defense authority, however, claimed relevant moves were "unsafe and unprofessional." The Australian side's claim distorts the facts and shifts blame onto China in an attempt to conceal its military aircraft's illegal intrusion, Jiang said, voicing strong dissatisfaction with the move and adding that the Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the Australian side. Noting that the Australian side's flawed arguments are completely untenable, the spokesperson urged Australia to immediately cease its violations and provocations, stop distorting and exaggerating the incident, and strictly control its maritime and air forces to avoid damaging relations between the two countries and their militaries. The Chinese military will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security, and firmly maintain regional peace and stability, Jiang said.
