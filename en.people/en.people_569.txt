Shenzhen's Qianhai: A hub for young people to start a business - People's Daily Online On Sept.15, 2025, reporters from People's Daily Online visited the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneur Hub located in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province. They experienced a series of cutting-edge scientific and technological achievements, including humanoid robots, smart chairs, and chess-playing robots. Beyond the technology, the hub's must-visit places, such as Hong Kong-style restaurants, specialty bookstores, and sky corridors, also left a strong impression on the reporters. Jointly established by the Qianhai Authority, the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, and the Shenzhen Youth Federation, the hub prioritizes the development of key industries, such as artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence, and life and health technologies. It is being described as the "first stop," "preferred destination," and "dream-fulfilling zone" for Hong Kong's young people to start businesses and seek employment on the Chinese mainland, and for sci-tech enterprises from the mainland to expand into Hong Kong.
