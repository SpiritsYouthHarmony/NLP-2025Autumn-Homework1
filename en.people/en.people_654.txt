Maria Novella Rossi: Understanding China through journalism - People's Daily Online Spring in Rome is a season of golden sunlight, gentle breezes, and pleasant warmth, creating a fitting backdrop for our meeting with journalist and sinologist Maria Novella Rossi. As a reporter at RAI, Rossi has dedicated her career to covering Chinese culture, with a strong belief in journalism's role in fostering intercultural understanding. Rossi's love for China began with a personal interest in Taoism, which led her to study Chinese philosophy in Italy. Between 1984 and 1986, she deepened this passion through academic studies in Chinese philosophy and literature at the Beijing Language Institute, known today as Beijing Language and Culture University. "It was an unforgettable experience," she recalled, "not only for my work, but also for my life." Maria Novella Rossi (Photo/Patrick Shead-Simmonds) Rossi officially joined RAI in 1999, where she has focused extensively on reporting about China. There was a lot of curiosity about the Chinese people, their culture, and the country as a whole, she explained. However, she also highlights the challenges of accurate reporting, noting that Western media coverage of China is often riddled with clichés, many of them stemming from journalists who have never set foot in the country. The cultural and geographical distance also makes it difficult to show an authentic image of Chinese culture and people. For Rossi, respect and knowledge are essential foundations for cultural dialogue. "You cannot offer an accurate judgment on other cultures without understanding them," she insisted. "Journalists need to dig deeper, judge less, and explain more," she said, adding that journalists and intellectuals carry the great responsibility of building bridges between East and West. Rossi's mission extends beyond daily reporting. She has also led documentary projects focusing on the Chinese diaspora in Italy. One such series, which she produced 10 years ago, highlighted personal stories of Chinese actresses, entrepreneurs, and engineers living in Italy. She is currently preparing a new project that will explore major tourist and UNESCO heritage sites in both countries, for example, the Colosseum in Italy and the Great Wall in China. Reflecting on contemporary China, Rossi describes it as a technologically advanced country. Visits to leading tech companies like Huawei in Shenzhen and Alibaba in Hangzhou left her impressed by the country's rapid development. She is particularly struck by advancements in AI, robotics, and digital finance. She noted, in China, almost everything can be done through WeChat, from booking a restaurant to paying taxes or buying a flight ticket. In today's world, where social media has accelerated the spread of misinformation, Rossi believes that journalism must stay grounded in ethics, credibility, and truth. It's essential to deliver quality information, protect freedom of expression, and uphold professional standards, she emphasized, noting that journalists play a vital role in helping people understand the world and in promoting cultural exchange.
