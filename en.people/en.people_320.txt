U.S. 'aid' to Gaza, a deadly trap for Gazans - People's Daily Online Cartoon by Ma Hongliang Steve Witkoff, the United States (U.S.) special envoy to the Middle East, recently visited Gaza and inspected an aid distribution site of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the U.S. and Israel. He shared on social media on that day that he spent hours in Gaza, "level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions, and meeting with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and other agencies." He added that the purpose of the visit was to give the President of the U.S. a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza. Since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation unilaterally "took over" aid distribution in Gaza, food deliveries have descended into chaos, with Gazans being killed while attempting to fetch food. According to data of the United Nations released on Aug. 1, at least 1,373 Palestinians have been killed while trying to obtain food aid since May 27, with over 800 of these deaths occurring near distribution sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. While claiming to provide "humanitarian relief" for Gazans, the U.S. has in fact handed aid distribution authority to Israel, talking humanitarianism while practicing hypocrisy.
