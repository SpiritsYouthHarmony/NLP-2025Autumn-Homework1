China Coast Guard warns off Philippine aircraft from Huangyan Dao airspace - People's Daily Online BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Thursday tracked, monitored and warned off two Philippine aircraft from the territorial airspace over China's Huangyan Dao, in accordance with the law and regulations. Recently, the Philippine side has been frequently dispatching aircraft to approach the sea and airspace near Huangyan Dao under various unfounded pretexts, engaging in provocations that seriously infringe upon China's sovereignty and undermine regional peace and stability, said CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun. Liu urged the Philippines to immediately cease its infringements, provocations, agitation and hyping. Stressing that Huangyan Dao is China's inherent territory, Liu said the CCG will continue to carry out rights protection and law enforcement operations in waters under China's jurisdiction to firmly safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.
