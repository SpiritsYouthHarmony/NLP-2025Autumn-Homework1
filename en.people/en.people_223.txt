China's Ningxia establishes conservation and research center in Helan Mountain to protect snow leopards - People's Daily Online This drone photo shows a snow leopard undergoing adaptive training at a conservation and research center in Helan Mountain Nature Reserve in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Oct. 24, 2025. In recent years, Ningxia has advanced the protection of snow leopards in the Helan Mountains by establishing a dedicated conservation and research center. The whole conservation chain includes the rescue, safe transfer, adaptive training, release, post-release monitoring, and field observation of snow leopards. Using technologies such as satellite tracking collars and infrared cameras, researchers can precisely monitor the felines' health and movements. The snow leopards which have been released into the wild are all reported to be in good condition.
