Beauty of Seasons: Minor Heat - People's Daily Online Hi everyone! I'm Sisi, a travel enthusiast! Today is Xiaoshu, or Minor Heat. Join me in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in southwest China's Guizhou Province, a place boasting breath-taking beauty, to escape the summer heat! In ancient times, people named this period "Minor Heat" because it signaled the beginning of hot weather, though the heat had not yet reached its peak. During this solar term, the sun blazes, rainfall increases, the fragrance of lotuses fills the air, and fruits emit a sweet scent. It is a season of vibrant growth for all living things. Having fresh grains was one of the main traditions among the folks in China. People grind the freshly rice harvested during the Minor Heat solar term and eat it to celebrate the harvest and pray for favorable weather and abundant crops in the following year. When Minor Heat comes, the Sanfu period begins. The Sanfu period, or "dog days of summer", refers to three 10-day periods based on the Chinese lunar calendar. Counting from the summer solstice, we will enter the Sanfu period after Minor Heat. Interestingly, in the West, people observed that the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, rises with the sun at dawn during the hottest time of the year. Believing this brought double the heat, they called this period the "dog days". Both China's Sanfu period and the "dog days" in Western countries show that different cultures have shared memories of summers intense heat. "A sudden breeze of warm air as Minor Heat arrives." In this time of flourishing life and intense heat, may you be as bright as the summer sun and enjoy every moment.
