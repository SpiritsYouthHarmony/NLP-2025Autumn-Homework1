Beauty of Seasons: End of Heat - People's Daily Online Hi, everyone. I'm Sisi, a travel enthusiast! Have you noticed the breeze in the mornings and evenings feels lighter now, and the once blazing sunlight has softened its glare? That's right—we've entered Chushu, or the End of Heat solar term, a gentle farewell to summer. Right now, I'm in the Kanas scenic area, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Come along with me and soak in this serene moment where late summer meets early autumn. The word "Chu" in Chushu has the meaning of "to cease," marking the gradual retreat of summer's heat and the quieting of all living things. In traditional Chinese culture, there are three phases, or "Chushu san hou": First, hawks begin their autumn hunting to stock up on food for the winter; second, the air and earth grow solemn; third, the grains ripen in the fields. These vivid natural signs reflect both a shift in the season and the traditional wisdom of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. In Kanas, the birch forests weave a dappled tapestry of silver trunks and kaleidoscopic leaves. When the wind rustles through, the small heart-shaped leaves whisper like autumn speaking in hushed tones. In the Kanas River valley, layers of pine trees tower like spires, their fine needles slicing sunlight into flickering shards of gold. It's honeydew season—the melons are ripe, under the warm embrace of sunlight, their thin skins hiding a burst of sweet flavor. The pastures are tinged with a pale golden hue, herds of cattle and sheep return leisurely to their pens, and from the Tuva people's wooden homes, wisps of smoke rise gently. The air is quietly infused with the scent of milk tea and butter. Meanwhile, Japan enters a time between Liqiu (Beginning of Autumn) and Chushu when people send letters or greeting cards to friends and family, wishing them health and reminding them to take care as the seasons shift. From the wooden cabins of Kanas to summer greetings in Kyoto, Chushu reminds us that the turning of the seasons is a shared language—one that transcends borders and speaks to all of humanity. "A cool breeze soothes the summer heat; all things enter the new autumn." Chushu is the journey from the height of summer into the fullness of autumn. Here in Kanas, that journey feels vast, peaceful, and deeply poetic. Has the scent of autumn reached you yet? Share your Chushu memories with us!
