(Xinhua/Wei Peiquan) In western Cambodia's Phnom Sruoch district, the abundant sunshine, plentiful rainfall, and fertile soil provide ideal natural conditions for mango cultivation, yielding mangoes featuring tender flesh and rich aroma. At the mango processing factory, invested and constructed by China's Zhong Bao (Fujian) Food Science & Technology Co. Ltd., in western Cambodia's Phnom Sruoch district, ripe mangoes undergo processes such as washing, peeling, slicing, sugar curing, and drying, finally transforming into sweet and chewy dried mango slices. These dried mangoes are then transported via sea shipping to Zhong Bao (Fujian) Food Science & Technology Co. Ltd. in southeast China's Fujian Province. After undergoing sorting, packaging, and packing, they can reach the shelves of Chinese supermarkets within days. The Chinese-invested mango processing factory was put into use in January, 2021. Since then, it has not only created employment for over 2,600 local residents but also resolved the critical issue of market access for Cambodian farmers. China's purchase of Cambodian dried mangoes has not only benefited small-scale farmers and workers in this rural area, but also contributed to boosting the local economy. The standards, expertise, and advanced production lines introduced by Chinese enterprises have also helped improve the reputation of Cambodian mangoes in recent years.
