China–Pakistan relations: A timeless friendship and everlasting partnership - People's Daily Online The friendship between China and Pakistan stands as one of the most enduring and exemplary relationships in modern international diplomacy — built on mutual respect, trust, and shared principles of sovereignty, equality, and peaceful coexistence. From its very inception, this relationship has reflected deep political foresight and a genuine sense of brotherhood between the two nations. Just three months after the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 1949, Pakistan sent an official delegation to Beijing on Jan. 4, 1950. It became one of the first countries to recognize the new Chinese government and sever ties with Taiwan — a bold and principled decision at a time when many nations hesitated to engage with the young Chinese state. Formal diplomatic relations were established on May 21, 1951, marking the beginning of an extraordinary journey of friendship that continues to grow stronger with each decade. Unlike many of China's other neighbors that have experienced fluctuating relations, Pakistan has consistently enjoyed smooth and friendly ties with Beijing. This stability stems from shared values, mutual non-interference, and complementary national interests. Both countries have always treated each other as equals and stood by one another through political changes and global transformations. When China faced isolation and hostility from the West during the 1950s, Pakistan stood firm as one of its few supporters. Despite pressure during the Cold War, Pakistan maintained trade and diplomatic warmth with China — even while it was part of Western alliances such as SEATO and CENTO. This balancing act reflected Pakistan's independent foreign policy and its commitment to China's friendship. One of Pakistan's most notable contributions to global diplomacy was its role in facilitating the rapprochement between China and the United States in the early 1970s. At a time when Washington and Beijing had no direct communication, Pakistan served as a trusted intermediary. It was through Pakistan that U.S. National Security Adviser Dr. Henry Kissinger secretly traveled to China in 1971 — paving the way for President Richard Nixon's historic visit the following year. This event not only transformed U.S.–China relations but also reshaped global geopolitics, underscoring Pakistan's importance as a facilitator of peace. Over the decades, despite political transitions in both countries, China–Pakistan relations have remained consistent and resilient. From Chairman Mao to President Xi Jinping, and from successive Pakistani civilian and military governments, every leadership has nurtured this friendship with sincerity and strategic vision. The relationship has never been person-dependent; it is driven by public sentiment, shared destiny, and long-term mutual interests. The partnership today spans politics, defense, economics, science, culture, and education. Both countries support each other's core national interests at global forums such as the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan steadfastly upholds the One-China Principle, while China supports Pakistan in safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The phrase often used to describe this relationship — "higher than the mountains, deeper than the oceans, stronger than steel, and sweeter than honey" — truly reflects its depth and endurance. Under Xi's visionary leadership, China–Pakistan relations have entered a new era of economic and strategic cooperation. The launch of the BRI in 2013 opened a new chapter, with Pakistan emerging as one of its strongest partners and beneficiaries. The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of the BRI, has transformed Pakistan's economic landscape — improving infrastructure, enhancing energy production, and fostering industrial growth. For China, CPEC provides a reliable partner in regional connectivity and a gateway for mutual development. Beyond economics, the China–Pakistan partnership also flourishes in education, science, and culture. Thousands of Pakistani students are pursuing higher education in China, while cultural exchanges continue to strengthen people-to-people bonds. Both nations emphasize peace, dialogue, and regional cooperation — contributing to a stable and prosperous South Asia. As the world undergoes profound changes, the China–Pakistan partnership stands as a beacon of stability and trust. Both nations share a vision of a peaceful, interconnected Asia built on mutual respect and collective progress. Pakistan regards China not only as its closest friend but also as a partner in its national development journey. China, in turn, considers Pakistan an indispensable partner in its vision of shared prosperity and building a community with a shared future for mankind. Over seven decades of unbroken friendship, China and Pakistan have demonstrated that international relations built on sincerity and equality can withstand every test of time. From Pakistan's early recognition of the People's Republic of China to the pioneering success of CPEC, their partnership remains a model of cooperation, respect, and mutual benefit. Truly, it is a "friendship for all seasons" — one that continues to inspire hope, unity, and shared progress across Asia and beyond. A call for responsible and constructive media engagement In recent months, an unusual and troubling phenomenon has been observed: a segment of the media, particularly on social media, circulating misleading and fabricated stories about Pakistan. These narratives, though limited and unrepresentative of mainstream official opinion, risk undermining the historic bond of mutual trust between the two "iron brothers." Such content, often based on rumors or distortion, has generated unnecessary misunderstanding and must be addressed through calm, constructive, and responsible media engagement. Given the deep-rooted friendship, the emergence of anti-Pakistan sentiments in certain media spaces is surprising and concerning. China has long been recognized for responsible media regulation and a commitment to social harmony; therefore, the circulation of unverified or divisive content contradicts the principles that underpin media policy. Such narratives not only misrepresent Pakistan but also mislead the public and risk eroding people-to-people goodwill that has been cultivated through decades of cooperation. It must be recalled that Pakistan's own media landscape has shown exemplary restraint and responsibility regarding China. In Pakistan, China is viewed not just as a partner but as a brotherly nation — a sentiment reflected in political, public, and cultural life alike. Every successive government in Islamabad, irrespective of political ideology, has placed China at the center of Pakistan's foreign policy and national development vision. In this context, the rise of anti-Pakistan narratives within segments of media is not only unfortunate but inconsistent with the spirit of China's global engagement. The Chinese media, known internationally for its discipline and professionalism, must ensure that malicious or misleading content — whether originating domestically or externally — is identified, corrected, and prevented from spreading. Fortunately, both China and Pakistan maintain robust communication mechanisms to prevent misunderstandings. Regular consultations between their foreign ministries, media cooperation committees, and security coordination bodies ensure that any misinformation or misperception can be swiftly addressed. High-level contact between leaders also reinforces this coordination. Both sides have consistently reaffirmed their commitment to the "all-weather strategic cooperative partnership." Recent developments further underscore this mutual understanding. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Ishaq Dar, speaking in the National Assembly earlier this month, categorically dismissed speculation that Pakistan's cooperation with the United States would harm ties with China. He emphasized that China remains central to Pakistan's foreign policy and that the relationship is "exceptional and time-tested." Similarly, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reaffirmed on Oct. 13, 2025, that Pakistan keeps Beijing fully informed about its cooperation with the U.S. in the mining sector. He clarified that Islamabad had assured China that its interactions with the U.S. "will never harm China's interests or its cooperation with China." Lin went further to reject rumors circulating on social media that sought to misinterpret a photograph of Pakistani leaders meeting U.S. officials. He clarified that the samples that the Pakistani leaders showed and gave to the U.S. leader are gem ores purchased by staff in Pakistan. "The reported stories are either misinformed or invented, or even designed to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan. They are just baseless." This official clarification reflects both sides' vigilance against misinformation and their determination to safeguard the integrity of bilateral relations. These coordinated responses from senior officials in both countries illustrate the resilience of the China–Pakistan friendship. Despite attempts by certain actors — possibly external — to create friction, the relationship remains grounded in mutual confidence and shared vision. The media plays a vital role in this context. Rather than amplifying falsehoods or divisive narratives, journalists and digital content creators should focus on positive, factual stories that highlight the strength of bilateral cooperation. The success of CPEC, the growing number of Pakistani students in China, joint technological ventures, and humanitarian collaboration all offer powerful examples of shared progress. To promote responsible journalism, both sides can enhance professional cooperation through media exchange programs, joint training workshops, and direct channels for fact-checking. Building such collaborative networks between Chinese and Pakistani journalists will strengthen understanding, prevent misreporting, and reinforce people-to-people trust. As this episode reminds us, responsible media engagement is essential for protecting a relationship built over generations. The China–Pakistan partnership has weathered every challenge and continues to stand as a beacon of brotherhood and solidarity. With wisdom, restraint, and mutual trust, both nations can ensure that their "iron bond" remains unshakable — a model for peace, stability, and understanding in an era of uncertainty.
