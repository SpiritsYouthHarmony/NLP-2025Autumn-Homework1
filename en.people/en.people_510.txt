Ornamental corn brings wealth to growers in SW China's Yunnan - People's Daily Online In Wenquan subdistrict, Anning city, southwest China's Yunnan Province, workers are busy harvesting a special variety of corn. At the same time, tourists join in by peeling the husks, creating an experience filled with curiosity and excitement as the vibrant colors of the corn are revealed. The ornamental corn is cultivated through traditional crossbreeding methods to achieve its striking hues, with no genetic engineering involved. As the corn matures, its kernels harden. Today, it is no longer valued as food but is cherished for its smooth texture and the warm, amber-like sheen that develops after repeated handling. The colorful corn reflects young people's desire for individuality and self-expression, while also embodying the traditional belief that having more children brings greater happiness. It has become a standout example of agricultural creativity. Behind the ornamental corn's popularity are more than two years of research and experimentation. The R&D team at Tianjian Four Seasons Agriculture Co., Ltd. conducted field trials throughout Yunnan and neighboring provinces before finally selecting the ideal site in Wenquan subdistrict. According to Li Yu, general manager of the company, Anning's average annual temperature of around 15 degrees Celsius and abundant sunlight create an ideal environment for this heat-loving crop. The real challenge in cultivating the corn lies in maintaining the purity of the variety and protecting its appearance. During pollination, the corn must be planted at least 100 meters away from other varieties, while pest control relies on eco-friendly methods such as sticky traps and biological pesticides. "In the past, growing regular corn brought in only about 800 yuan ($112) per mu (0.067 hectares). Now, growing ornamental corn earns me between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan per mu, plus an additional 100 yuan a day in wages," said Zhang Guiqiong, a local villager. The city government invested 700,000 yuan to build a smart irrigation system, while the subdistrict office helped expand sales channels. Meanwhile, the local agriculture and rural affairs bureau organized training sessions to teach villagers how to add value to their harvest. Thanks to this targeted support, over 120 mu of previously idle land have been transformed into what is now China's largest single-site plantation of ornamental corn. After being naturally dried, carefully selected and creatively crafted, the colorful corn takes on many new forms. Mounted on wooden bases, it becomes a decorative ornament. Single kernels, drilled and paired with Yunnan silver, are made into bracelets, keychains, pendants, wall art and more.
