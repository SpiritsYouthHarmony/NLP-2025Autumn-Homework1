Upholding equality, mutual benefit in China-U.S. economic, trade relations - People's Daily Online On the afternoon of Sept.14 local time, China and the United States began talks on economic and trade issues in Madrid, Spain. The two sides will discuss issues such as the unilateral tariff measures adopted by the U.S., the abuse of export controls and the TikTok issue. China will, as always, firmly safeguard its legitimate interests and uphold the multilateral trading system, while urging the U.S. to engage more in equal dialogue, foster mutual trust, mitigate misunderstandings, strengthen cooperation, and jointly advance an open global economy. China-U.S. economic and trade relations remain fundamentally mutually beneficial. In recent months, guided by the important consensus reached between the two heads of state, the economic and trade teams of both countries held three rounds of talks in Geneva, London, and Stockholm, achieving positive outcomes that have played a constructive role in stabilizing bilateral economic and trade relations. The significance of U.S.-China trade extends beyond both nations to global economic stability. China continues to demonstrate responsibility in managing differences and resolving frictions through cooperation. Amid weakened global growth momentum, collaboration presents the only viable path forward, while protectionism proves counterproductive. The international community acknowledges progress in these consultations and encourages sustained dialogue to reinforce the stability of global trade governance. China will continue to uphold principles protecting the lawful rights of its enterprises. TikTok has operated successfully in the U.S. for years, serving millions of engaged Americans while contributing to U.S. job creation and economic growth. Its market-driven innovation and compliance with local laws warrant equitable treatment. The Chinese government attaches great importance to data privacy and security, and has never required and will never require companies or individuals to illegally transfer overseas data to Chinese authorities. The U.S. practice of politicizing trade issues undermines market principles and damages its own business environment credibility. Commercial arrangements involving Chinese enterprises must comply with Chinese law. If such arrangements involve transferring technology abroad, whether through trade, investment, or other channels, they must adhere to the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of the Import and Export of Technologies and undergo government approval procedures in accordance with law. This safeguards national economic security while promoting orderly international technological cooperation. China remains open to consultations addressing mutual concerns through respectful dialogue. The U.S. must provide Chinese enterprises like TikTok with an open, fair, and non-discriminatory operating environment. Should U.S. actions undermine legitimate Chinese interests, China will take necessary measures in response. Reaching consensus in any dialogue requires joint efforts from both sides. Seeking to benefit at the expense of the other is no recipe for long-term engagement. Both China and the U.S. should earnestly implement the important consensus reached during the phone call of the two heads of state, fully leverage the positive role of the economic and trade consultation mechanism, and pursue mutual benefit and win-win outcomes on the basis of equality, respect, and reciprocity. Only through genuine cooperation can China and the U.S. deliver meaningful outcomes that serve both nations and the global community.
