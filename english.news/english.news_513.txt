(Xinhua/Li Jing) TURIN, Italy, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's automobile manufacturers are rapidly becoming an important driving force in Europe's auto industry, bringing fresh design ideas, competitive electric-vehicle technology and growing market presence to the continent, Andrea Levy, president of Turin Auto Show, told Xinhua in a recent interview. Held across open city blocks in the northern Italian city, the 2025 Turin Auto Show blends Italy's long-standing design tradition with an increasingly international exhibitor list. This year the show unveiled the Turin Automotive Design Award for the first time, a professional prize established with European official backing to promote cooperation between Chinese and European automakers. An independent international jury made up of nine leading Italian automotive design and R&D institutes selected winners that included Chinese marques such as Changan, JAC, Geely and Jetour, Levy said, praising the awards as recognition of China's rising design capabilities and a step toward closer Sino-Italian industrial ties. Seventeen Chinese automakers brought new models to Turin this year - about one-third of all exhibitors - Levy noted that BYD, Denza, Dongfeng and JAC were among them, with several brands making their Italian debut." "For example, BYD presented its premium Denza brand, Dongfeng launched a new sub-brand, and Zeekr exhibited its models," he said, noting that Chinese high-performance electric models - like the Zeekr 001 FR with its 800-horsepower output - have showcased the technical capabilities of these brands to Italian audiences. The show is expected to attract some 500,000 visitors, Levy added. "Taking part in international motor shows is very important for Chinese brands. Many European consumers have been unfamiliar with Chinese cars, but here they can see the design and technical strength with their own eyes." Levy believes Chinese manufacturers are well positioned to accelerate Europe's shift from internal-combustion engines to electrification. He said that Italy's adoption of pure electric vehicles has lagged behind other European countries. He estimated EVs make up roughly 5 percent of Italy's market, compared with more than 10 percent in Germany and France and over 50 percent in Norway, and said that China's combination of advanced battery and charging technologies, plus attractive pricing, gives Chinese automakers significant potential. "Chinese cars are technologically advanced, support very fast charging and are competitively priced," Levy said. "Some Chinese models already support ultra-fast 400-kilowatt charging, allowing a recharge in about 15 minutes - an experience that is new for many Italian consumers." He argued that such strengths will help European buyers transition from fuel vehicles to electric models more quickly. On how Chinese manufacturers can deepen their presence in Europe, Levy emphasized visibility and hands-on experience. "European consumers tend to have long-standing trust in traditional local brands. Chinese marques lack that historical familiarity. But if consumers can test-drive these cars and the media cover them, perceptions will change - because the cars perform well, are well designed and are reasonably priced." Levy also highlighted the natural complementarity between the two countries. Italy's global renown in car design - the home of masters such as Pininfarina and Giorgetto Giugiaro - and its logistics networks offer entry points for Chinese manufacturers. "Many Chinese firms have already set up design centers in Turin to develop global models; Changan is one example," he said. "Italy is not only a design hub in Europe, it is also an important gateway. Vehicles arriving through Italian ports can be distributed across Europe, and Italian logistics companies can help build a continent-wide sales network." Describing cooperation as mutually beneficial, Levy said Italy's expertise in high-performance vehicle design can be coupled with China's extensive experience in batteries and electrification. "Such cooperation can teach Italy more about electric-vehicle technology while helping Chinese automakers establish themselves in Europe," he said. Looking ahead, the Turin Auto Show plans to go beyond vehicle displays and to build concrete industry linkages. "In 2026 we plan to create a dedicated section within the show to facilitate China-Italy and broader China-Europe automotive cooperation, providing matchmaking opportunities and helping firms establish new commercial contacts," Levy said. Concluding the interview, Levy expressed admiration for the pace and scale of China's auto industry development. "Chinese cars are not only technologically advanced and attractively designed, they are becoming an integral part of the global automotive industry. The Turin Auto Show is willing to act as an important bridge for Chinese brands entering Europe, he said. "We welcome more Chinese automakers to exhibit." ■ Visitors view an exhibit car of BYD at Turin Auto Show in Turin, Italy, Sept. 27, 2025.
