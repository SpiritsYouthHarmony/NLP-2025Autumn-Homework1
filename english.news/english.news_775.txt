Column: Cambodia-China ties -- A partnership built on mutual trust, win-win cooperation-Xinhua The deep-rooted Cambodia-China friendship has greatly benefited Cambodia, particularly in the development of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and airports, as well as in the energy sector, all central to Cambodia's economic growth. by Joseph Matthews The Cambodia-China partnership has evolved well beyond economic and political cooperation, becoming deeply rooted in mutual trust, respect and support, and a shared commitment to achieving win-win outcomes. Cambodia and China established formal diplomatic ties in 1958. Over the past 67 years, the two countries have enjoyed frequent high-level exchanges, which have reinforced their strategic political trust, solidified a longstanding friendship and fostered mutual benefits. Their relationship is grounded in the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which emphasizes mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Guided by these principles, the bilateral relationship was elevated to a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation in 2010, with Cambodia recognizing China as its "most trusted friend," while China viewed Cambodia as its "iron-clad friend." This deep-rooted friendship has greatly benefited Cambodia, particularly in the development of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports and airports, as well as in the energy sector, all central to Cambodia's economic growth. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has played a significant role in these advancements, attracting major Chinese investments, including hydropower plants, the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone and the Siem Reap Angkor International Airport. These projects reflect the seamless collaboration between the two countries, unlocking new opportunities for investment, trade, sustainable development, tourism growth and agricultural modernization. These efforts have been crucial in supporting Cambodia's socio-economic development and its fight against poverty. The alignment of the BRI with Cambodia's Pentagonal Strategy has laid a solid foundation for strengthening infrastructure connectivity, trade relations, technological innovation, financial integration and people-to-people exchanges. Within the frameworks of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, Cambodia has also benefited from preferential tariffs on exports, particularly agricultural products, to China. Cambodia believes that by combining China's expertise in digital agriculture, advanced aquaculture and effective rural governance with its own rich natural resources, the two countries can promote sustainable growth in rural communities, enhance food security, and foster inclusive economic development. Looking ahead, the future of Cambodia-China relations is promising. Cambodia has consistently supported the China-proposed global initiatives, including the BRI, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. These initiatives provide valuable frameworks for addressing shared global challenges and promoting stability and prosperity in an increasingly interconnected world. The Cambodia-China "Diamond Hexagon" cooperation framework is more than just a conceptual plan; it is a living partnership, continually strengthened by innovation, mutual trust and shared sacrifices. Overall, the robust bilateral cooperation across various sectors has been a driving force in building a high-quality, high-level and high-standard Cambodia-China community with a shared future in the new era. This unbreakable "iron-clad" friendship has not only brought significant benefits to both countries and their people, but also played a vital role in promoting peace, security, stability and shared prosperity in the region and beyond.
