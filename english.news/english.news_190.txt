GLOBALink | Sports Beats of 24 Solar Terms: Autumn Equinox-Xinhua The 24 solar terms, consisting of 12 major solar terms and 12 minor solar terms, were created thousands of years ago by the ancient Chinese to guide agricultural production. Today, the culture behind the terms provides useful guidance to people's lives as each term features special food, cultural ceremonies and healthy living tips. "Qiufen," or Autumn Equinox, is the 16th solar term on the Chinese lunar calendar. It falls on Sept. 23 this year. On Autumn Equinox Day, day and night are of equal lengths, and so are cold and heat. At this time, autumn grains are harvested. The summer heat has passed, and most areas of China have entered the cool autumn. It is an ideal season for sporting activities.
