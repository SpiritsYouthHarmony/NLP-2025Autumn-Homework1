2 killed in Israeli airstrike on southern Lebanon-Xinhua BEIRUT, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed Monday in an Israeli drone strike in southern Lebanon, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported. Citing the Health Ministry's emergency center, the NNA said the strike hit a site on the outskirts of the village of Al-Bayad in the Tyre district, killing two brothers and wounding several others. A Lebanese army intelligence source told Xinhua that the victims were Hezbollah members Hussein and Hassan Suleiman. The Israeli military confirmed it carried out the strike, saying it killed two men affiliated with Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force. It identified them as Hussein and Hassan Suleiman and said both had been involved in "advancing numerous terrorist attacks toward Israeli territory." The Lebanese army said it later recovered an Israeli drone that crashed in the village of Markaba, near the eastern sector of the border. In a separate incident, the NNA reported that an Israeli drone dropped a sound bomb near the village of Mays al-Jabal, with no injuries reported. Although a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah has been in place since November 2024, Israel continues near-daily strikes in Lebanon, saying they target ongoing Hezbollah threats along the border. Lebanon and several international organizations have condemned the attacks as violations of the truce. ■
