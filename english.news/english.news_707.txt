On a year-over-year basis, gasoline prices fell less in September than in August due to a base-year effect, leading to an acceleration in headline inflation, said the national statistical agency. Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 2.6 percent in September, after increasing 2.4 percent in August, it said. A slower decline in prices for travel tours and a larger increase in prices for food purchased from stores also contributed to the upward pressure in the all-items CPI in September, according to the agency. The CPI rose 0.1 percent month over month in September, it added. ■ Customers shop at a market in Toronto, Canada, Oct. 21, 2025.
