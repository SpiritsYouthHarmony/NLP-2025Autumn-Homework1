Column: Asia's ascendance: an invitation to build a better world-Xinhua by Maya Majueran Asia, home to over half of the global population with over a third of global GDP, has become a dynamic epicenter of growth, innovation and geopolitical influence. As economic integration deepens through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Asia's role in shaping 21st-century governance, sustainability and multilateralism will continue to expand. In recent years, Asia has placed greater emphasis on regional cooperation to strengthen economic resilience in the face of rising protectionism and global market uncertainty. By deepening intra-regional ties, Asia aims to build an economic framework that can better withstand external shocks while advancing shared development goals. A unified diplomatic front could further amplify this momentum. Collective action in forums like the WTO and G20 would not only strengthen Asia's voice but also help stabilize a fractured global trading system. Asia's development is not a replication of Western models, but is deeply rooted in local cultures and traditions encouraging social cohesion, collective responsibility and excellence, as well as long-term planning. The emphasis on education and discipline has also translated into rapid technological advancement while successfully preparing large workforces for innovation-driven industries. This cultural distinctiveness challenges the notion that Western-style liberal democracy is the only viable path to prosperity, a critical lesson as Western societies face internal pressures and systemic challenges. Asia's combined economic heft creates a unique opportunity to improve global governance. Yet building a truly multipolar world demands more than economic restructuring. It requires a shift in mindset, particularly from the West. Respect can no longer be assumed based on historical dominance, it must be earned through genuine engagement and acknowledgment of different developmental trajectories. Asia's success stems not from exploitation but from sustained investment in education, infrastructure and innovation. It is a model of cooperation rather than coercion, offering an alternative vision for progress grounded in inclusion and shared prosperity. For Western nations, adapting to these global shifts means moving beyond notions of superiority or assumed leadership. Embracing mutual respect by recognizing different governance models and historical contexts can unlock powerful new partnerships. Shared challenges such as climate change, pandemics and global inequality require collaborative solutions that draw on the strengths of both the East and the West. Asia's rise should not be viewed as a threat, but an invitation: to rethink global cooperation, broaden the definition of progress, and embrace a truly multipolar and equitable world order. The 21st century will not be defined by a singular superpower, but by collaborative leadership and shared responsibility. Asia's rise marks not just an economic shift, but a civilizational rebalancing. It offers an alternative vision for global progress rooted in cultural diversity, historical depth and forward-looking policy. To thrive in this new era, the world must move beyond binaries of the East and the West. It must embrace mutual respect, adapt to multipolarity, and build inclusive systems that reflect the realities of a diverse and interconnected planet. In doing so, Asia is not just participating in shaping the future, it is helping lead it.
