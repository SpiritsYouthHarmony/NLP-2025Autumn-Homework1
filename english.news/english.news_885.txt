Tunisia receives over 21,000 Chinese tourists by Oct. 2025-Xinhua TUNIS, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia received more than 21,000 Chinese tourists between Jan. 1 and Oct. 20, 2025, marking a 17.9 percent increase year on year, local media reported Wednesday. Despite the increase, the number remains below pre-pandemic levels, which stood at around 25,000 Chinese visitors in 2019, Mohamed Mehdi Hlaoui, director general of the Tunisian National Tourist Office (ONTT), said in an interview with private radio station Mosaique FM. To further boost arrivals from China, Hlaoui underscored the importance of enhancing air connectivity between the two countries. He revealed that the national carrier is considering launching a direct flight between Tunis and Beijing as early as 2026. According to the ONTT official, Tunisia recorded 9.05 million tourist arrivals as of Oct. 20 this year, a 9.2 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024. Efforts are underway to reach the national target of 11 million tourist arrivals by the end of the year. Authorities are focusing on improving service quality, diversifying tourism products, and promoting cultural, ecological, sports and wellness tourism, Hlaoui said. The official also reported positive growth in regional tourism markets. The number of Algerian visitors rose by 5 percent year on year, with significant increases recorded in September and October. Meanwhile, tourist arrivals from Libya surged by 30 percent. Hlaoui attributed the overall performance to strengthened tourism cooperation and targeted promotional campaigns in key markets across the Maghreb region and Asia. ■
