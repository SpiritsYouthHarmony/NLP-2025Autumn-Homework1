Jointly organized by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar and the Center for Language Education and Cooperation, the event drew more than 1,000 participants from government organizations, business associations, civil societies, educational institutions, and media organizations from both countries. According to the organizers, the contest aimed to provide a platform for Chinese song enthusiasts in Myanmar, promote cultural exchanges among Chinese language learners, enrich cultural life, inspire appreciation for both Chinese and Myanmar traditions, and strengthen bilateral friendship.
