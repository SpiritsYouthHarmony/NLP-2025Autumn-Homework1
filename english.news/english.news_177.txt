Study reveals new immune defense against dangerous fungal infections-Xinhua JERUSALEM, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have discovered a previously unknown immune defense mechanism that protects against dangerous Candida fungal infections, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said Monday in a statement. Candida is a common type of yeast that is part of the normal human body, found in places like the mouth, gut, and skin. However, when there is an overgrowth of this fungus, it can cause infections. The study, published in Nature Communications, showed that eosinophils, which are white blood cells known for their role in allergies, recognize Candida through a surface receptor called CD48. When this receptor detects the fungal protein Als6, eosinophils release powerful substances that stop fungal growth, read the statement. The discovery is particularly important for hospital patients with weakened immunity, where Candida infections can become life-threatening and are often difficult to treat, said the university. It noted that the finding points to new treatment approaches that could boost the body's natural defense through enhancing eosinophil function or targeting the CD48-Als6 interaction. ■
