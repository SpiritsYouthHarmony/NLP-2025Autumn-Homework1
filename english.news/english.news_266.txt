China unveils detailed measures for charging special port fees on U.S. ships-Xinhua BEIJING, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Transport on Tuesday revealed a detailed document regarding measures to charge special port fees on ships owned or operated by U.S. enterprises, organizations and individuals. The document, composed of 10 articles, clarifies specific provisions on the charging scope and standards, entities to collect the fees, payable voyages, the date of implementation and other relevant aspects. Exemptions from these special port fees will be granted to ships built by China, empty ships entering Chinese shipyards purely for repair purposes, and other ships that are deemed exempted from payment, according to the document. This document also notes that the scope and standards of fees, and the charging period, will be dynamically adjusted in line with the situation at the time of implementation. These detailed measures were unveiled following the ministry's announcement on Oct. 10 that China will charge special port fees on U.S. ships starting Oct. 14 -- in response to the U.S. move to impose additional port fees on Chinese ships after a Section 301 investigation. The U.S. action seriously violates WTO rules and the China-U.S. maritime transport agreement, causing severe damage to maritime trade between the two countries, the ministry said -- adding that China's decision to levy special port fees on U.S. ships is a justified measure to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese industries and enterprises, and to ensure a fair competitive environment in international shipping. ■
