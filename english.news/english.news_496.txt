Brazil voices concern over U.S. threats against Venezuela-Xinhua RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- The chief advisor to the president of Brazil voiced deep concern Friday over growing U.S. threats of military action against Venezuela. In an interview with local outlet Metropoles, Celso Amorim dismissed attempts to link Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to terrorism. "You may like him or not, but Maduro is not a sponsor of terrorism," he said. Amorim warned that the deployment of U.S. forces near Venezuela and the authorization of covert CIA operations by U.S. President Donald Trump have heightened tensions in the Caribbean and raised alarm across Latin America. He stressed that "any conflict in the region must be resolved through dialogue and respect for national sovereignty." Brazil maintains diplomatic relations with Venezuela and has repeatedly opposed any foreign military intervention. ■
