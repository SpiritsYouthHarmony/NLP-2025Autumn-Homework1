Speaking at the MOBEX Africa Tech Expo and Innovation Conference 2025 in Accra, the capital, Ablakwa said the e-visa system is part of the foreign ministry's efforts to modernize Ghana's diplomatic services in the digital age. The e-visa system would make it easier for investors, technologists, and business professionals to visit and work in Ghana, he said. Ablakwa also highlighted the ministry's broader digital initiatives, including digital consular services for Ghanaians abroad and virtual diplomatic engagements aimed at expanding reach and reducing costs. On the conference theme, "Resetting Africa's Digital Identity and Sovereignty," he stressed the need for Africa to seize opportunities in technology and leverage digitalization for transformation. He noted that the success of initiatives like the African Continental Free Trade Area will depend on robust digital connectivity. To bridge the digital divide, the ministry is collaborating with African counterparts to reduce barriers to cross-border digital services and enable mutual recognition of digital credentials. ■
