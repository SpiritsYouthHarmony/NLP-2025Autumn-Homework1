The walkout affects more than 500 hospitals and medical facilities, mainly in California and Hawaii, including several in the Los Angeles area, according to local media reports. The five-day strike began at 7 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday and is scheduled to end at 7 a.m. Sunday, according to a post on Kaiser Permanente's official website. The action marks the largest strike in the 50-year history of the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals, the union representing the workers. "Kaiser employees are launching a 5-day strike against Kaiser Permanente -- not because they want to, but because they have to," the union said in a media release. The strike aims to win safe staffing, fair pay, and protect patient care, it added. In a statement, Kaiser Permanente called the strike "unnecessary and disruptive," saying the company remains committed to reaching an agreement that balances fair pay with high-quality, affordable care. ■
