China-funded road connecting two provinces in Cambodia inaugurated-Xinhua TBONG KHMUM, Cambodia, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia on Saturday inaugurated the China-funded National Road 71C, connecting the eastern Tbong Khmum province with the southeastern Kampong Cham province. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wenbin attended the event. Hun Manet said the 114.9-km road is crucial to facilitating travel and goods transportation and will play an important role in helping boost the local economy and tourism development. Hun Manet said China is an "indispensable friend" of Cambodia for socio-economic development. China is recognized as No. 1 partner, who has been providing a great amount of concessional loans and grants for the development of infrastructure, including roads and bridges in Cambodia, he said. He said that alignment between China's Belt and Road Initiative and Cambodia's Pentagonal Strategy has provided "win-win results". Speaking at the event, Wang said to date, China has helped construct national roads in a total length of over 4,000 km and more than 10 large-scale bridges. "Roads and bridges across the Mekong and Tonle Sap River have not only facilitated the daily travel of the Cambodian people, but also injected vigorous energy into the development of Cambodia," he said. "This is a vivid example of alignment between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Pentagonal Strategy," he added. ■
