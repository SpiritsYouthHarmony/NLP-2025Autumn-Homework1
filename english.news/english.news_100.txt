Boca rallies to beat Barracas after early red-Xinhua BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Milton Gimenez scored twice as Boca Juniors recovered from a goal down to clinch a 3-1 away win over 10-man Barracas Central in Argentina's Primera Division on Monday. The hosts were reduced to 10 men in the 14th minute when Ivan Tapia was shown a second yellow card for a bad challenge on Leandro Paredes. Despite the numerical disadvantage, Barracas took the lead through Rodrigo Insua, who pounced on a loose ball before firing a 40-yard rocket into the top-left corner. Boca equalized shortly after halftime as Gimenez combined with Exequiel Zeballos and finished clinically past goalkeeper Marcos Ledesma. Gimenez put his side ahead three minutes later by meeting Juan Barinaga's cross from the right flank to nod in from eight yards. The visitors were in cruise control and Miguel Merentiel made it 3-1 just after the hour, timing his run to perfection to tap in from close range following Zeballos' probing run and cross. "We treated this match like a final," Gimenez told reporters. "We were playing well but they scored a freak goal and we had to find another gear. Thankfully we were able to turn it around and get an important win." The result leaves Boca third in Group A with 20 points from 13 outings, a point behind leader Central Cordoba. Barracas is 10th, two points further back. ■
