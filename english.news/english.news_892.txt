His story, marked by resilience and international cooperation, now stands as a testament to the transformative power of medical aid and human compassion. According to his son, it started with a troublesome bloating until severe abdominal pain left Makame unable to defecate and vomiting uncontrollably. Doctors found an intestinal obstruction and a mass in the sigmoid colon, and they performed an emergency colostomy to save his life. "Although I have many kids, I struggled with the physical and emotional toll of the stoma, and the daily challenges of managing the device without assistance left me feeling isolated and vulnerable," Makame, who lives alone, recalled to Xinhua. Weeks later, a bulge formed around the stoma, which was diagnosed as a parastomal hernia. Despite further surgery and three rounds of chemotherapy, his tumor did not respond well. Haitham Hassan, a local doctor of Lumumba Hospital, said that as the case grew increasingly complex, a surgical resection was being considered. In the nick of time, the 35th Chinese medical team in Zanzibar arrived at Lumumba Hospital. Among them was Bao Zengtao, a general surgeon and the team leader, who spared no effort to save Makame. Bao, together with Hassan, initiated a comprehensive evaluation, including enhanced abdominal CT scans and tumor marker tests. Bao concluded that Makame was suitable for minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery, a technique previously deemed unviable for such a complex case. "Many assumed open surgery was the only option," Bao explained. "But with careful assessment and collaboration, we saw a path forward that could minimize trauma and accelerate recovery." The surgical team expanded to include Zhang Shuxian, an endoscopy specialist, who helped confirm the tumor's precise location and the functionality of the proximal bowel. CT scans revealed no signs of metastasis, paving the way for a bold and unprecedented operation. On the day of surgery, a multidisciplinary squad assembled: Bao led the procedure, backed by Hassan, urologist Wang Kunpeng, and anesthesiologist Luan Hengfei. Together, they performed a laparoscopic radical resection of the sigmoid colon cancer, reversed the stoma, and repaired the hernia, all in one operation. It was the first such case in Zanzibar to be treated using this advanced technique. "I no longer have to suffer the pain of a stoma. I can live like a normal person again," he expressed heartfelt gratitude to the medical team. His words resonated deeply with the Chinese doctors, many of whom have spent years serving in Africa under China's medical aid program. Since the 1960s, over 800 Chinese medical professionals have worked in Zanzibar, performing more than 240,000 surgeries and saving tens of thousands of lives. The 35th Chinese medical team continues this legacy, bringing not only expertise but also vital equipment and training. Earlier this year, the Zanzibar Ministry of Health received medical supplies from the Chinese government to support surgical operations and launch specialized medical camps across the archipelago. Tanzania's Zanzibar President Hussein Ali Mwinyi recently honored members of the 34th Chinese medical team for their distinguished service, underscoring the enduring partnership between China and Tanzania in the health sector. As Makame begins a new chapter, free from the burdens that once confined him, it is a reminder that behind every surgical milestone lies a human life transformed, and that healing knows no borders. ■ Chinese and Tanzanian doctors pose for photos with patient Omar Haji Makame after a successful laparoscopic surgery at Lumumba Hospital in Zanzibar, Tanzania, Oct. 20, 2025.
