(Chinese expert team/Handout via Xinhua) DAR ES SALAAM, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese health experts are helping Tanzania's Zanzibar to eliminate schistosomiasis through the promotion of Chinese prevention and control standards and advanced diagnostic techniques. To mark the 56th World Standards Day, the Chinese expert team of the schistosomiasis control project in Zanzibar held a training workshop on Tuesday to beef up promotion of Chinese schistosomiasis standards. The event brought together more than 60 technical professionals from Zanzibar's health departments, during which the experts introduced key national standards derived from China's successful experience in schistosomiasis control. These included standards for patient management, detection methods using urine filtration microscopy, nucleic acid detection through recombinase-aided isothermal amplification, and snail control through molluscicide application. The experts detailed a full standardized workflow covering case reporting, laboratory testing, field snail control, and results documentation, emphasizing that standardized procedures are crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. Wang Wei, the team leader, said the event enhanced local health workers' understanding of schistosomiasis control standards and equipped them with diagnostic skills, strengthening the island's capacity in disease surveillance, diagnosis, and prevention. ■
