Capital Area Food Bank provides free food to U.S. federal employees, contractors amid gov't shutdown-Xinhua Federal employees and contractors receive food items during a free food distribution in Hyattsville, Maryland, the United States, on Oct. 21, 2025. Starting this week, the nonprofit Capital Area Food Bank started to provide special free food distributions to U.S. federal employees and contractors. Over the past weeks, the impact of the government shutdown has gradually become apparent. About 750,000 federal employees in so-called "non-essential" positions have been furloughed without pay, while hundreds of thousands in "essential" roles remain on the job -- also without pay. Against the backdrop of rising food prices and high mortgage costs, the inability to receive timely paychecks has placed significant financial pressure on many federal workers.
