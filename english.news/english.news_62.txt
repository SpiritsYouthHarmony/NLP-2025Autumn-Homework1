Former Brazilian President Bolsonaro appeals 27-year prison term-Xinhua BRASILIA, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday filed an appeal with the Supreme Federal Court, requesting a review and reduction of the 27-year and 3-month prison term he received for his role in a failed coup attempt in 2023. Bolsonaro's legal team argued that the trial was marked by due process violations, including a lack of proper defense and reliance on what they called a flawed and contradictory plea bargain testimony. They also cited legal errors in how the charges were applied. In September, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by a 4-1 vote that Bolsonaro had led a criminal organization seeking to keep him in power following his 2022 election defeat. The former president was convicted of five charges: attempting a coup d'etat, violently seeking to abolish the democratic rule of law, leading an armed criminal organization, aggravated property damage, and destruction of protected historical heritage. ■
