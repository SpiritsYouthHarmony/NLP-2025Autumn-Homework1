Vinicius plays down Clasico rift-Xinhua MADRID, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid's Brazilian winger Vinicius Jr has apologized for his behavior after being substituted in the second half of his side's 2-1 win over FC Barcelona on Sunday. Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso replaced Vinicius by Rodrygo, which enraged the winger. Vinicius walked off the pitch, shouting and making angry gestures, before storming down the players' tunnel, in actions that provoked almost as many headlines as the match result. Vinicius later returned to the Real Madrid dugout and picked up a booking after being involved in the angry scenes between both sets of players at the final whistle as the Real Madrid players recriminated with Lamine Yamal for comments, he had made before the match implying that Real Madrid "robbed" games. Vinicius' behavior has renewed speculation the club could try to sell him as contract talks reportedly stalled, but in an interview with Real Madrid TV, the Brazilian tried to make light of the incidents. "El Clasico is like that: There are a lot of things happening on and off the pitch," he said, insisting he "didn't want to offend anyone, not Barca players, nor the fans." "We try to maintain a balance," continued Vinicius, before adding that "we know that when we step on to the pitch, we have to defend our side, and that's how it was." ■
