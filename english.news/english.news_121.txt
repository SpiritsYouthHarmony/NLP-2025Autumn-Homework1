Hong Kong to launch exhibition on ancient Egyptian civilization-Xinhua HONG KONG, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Palace Museum announced on Friday that 250 ancient Egyptian treasures have arrived at the museum for the exhibition, "Ancient Egypt Unveiled: Treasures from Egyptian Museums," which will be held from Nov. 20, 2025, to Aug. 31, 2026. Organized by the Hong Kong Palace Museum in collaboration with the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) of Egypt, the exhibition marks the largest, most comprehensive, and longest-running display of ancient Egyptian treasures in Hong Kong. For the first time, Hong Kong will exhibit museum artefacts and the latest archaeological findings directly loaned from Egypt. The exhibition is organized into four thematic sections and showcases 250 precious artefacts. Spanning nearly 4,000 years of history, the exhibits include monumental statues, painted and inscribed stone stelae, mummy coffins and masks, jewelry, everyday objects, and animal mummies. Many of these artefacts are being displayed outside Egypt for the very first time. Furthermore, over ten multimedia installations inside and outside the gallery will offer engaging experiences, such as a dynamic display of the mummification process and the excavation of Tutankhamun's tomb. ■
