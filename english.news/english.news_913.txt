Feature: Zanzibar woman cultivates change with Chinese Juncao grass-Xinhua Tanzanian dairy farmer Tahiya Bauso Massawe works in her Juncao grass field in Zanzibar, Tanzania, Sept. 19, 2025. (Xinhua/Emmanuel Herman) by Xinhua writers Hua Hongli, Lucas Liganga DAR ES SALAAM, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- In Zanzibar's Bumbisudi village, a lush carpet of green stretches under the morning sun as dairy farmer Tahiya Bauso Massawe moves between rows of Juncao grass, a Chinese agricultural innovation that has improved her livelihood and inspired women across her community. "This grass changed everything," Massawe said, watching her 30 dairy cows gather for their morning feed. "I have kept cows for 20 years, but the real change began when I started feeding them Juncao." Juncao, a term combining the Chinese words for "mushroom" and "grass," was introduced to Massawe through Tanzania's Ministry of Agriculture. Developed by researchers of Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University of China, the technology is globally renowned for its versatility. Beyond animal feed, it can be used for mushroom cultivation and soil erosion control. Massawe's journey began modestly, from just a packet of seeds and a dose of skepticism. "It looked like sugarcane," she recalled. "We planted it, replanted the stalks, and slowly expanded. Eventually, we had enough to feed the cows." The results were remarkable. Milk yields doubled, with each cow now producing up to 30 liters a day, compared to the previous 15 to 20 liters. Her farm's total output surged from 90 liters to 150 liters daily, enabling her to purchase a feed-chopping machine and a transport truck worth 12 million Tanzanian shillings (about 4,600 U.S. dollars). But Massawe's success has rippled beyond her household. She now employs 16 workers, creating new opportunities for her community. "Women here have gained income and independence," she said. "They can support their families without relying on others." Eager to empower more women, Massawe distributes Juncao seeds free of charge. "Even if they do not own cows, they can grow the grass and sell it to livestock keepers," she said. "It is a path to income." With five hectares of Juncao now under cultivation, Massawe hopes to expand further, if irrigation support can be secured. "A water pump would allow me to grow more and help even more women," she said. Chinese researchers behind the project said Juncao helps communities adapt to climate change, restore degraded land and improve food security. Recognized by the United Nations as a sustainable development tool, Juncao technology has reached more than 100 countries since its inception in the 1980s. In Africa, where feed shortages and land degradation remain major challenges, the grass offers an affordable and eco-friendly solution. For Massawe, the impact is deeply personal. Her cows are healthier, need fewer supplements, and behave more calmly. "They eat less, drink more water, and rest better," she noted. "I commend the Chinese for this innovation. It has uplifted the poor." Her farm has since become a hub of learning and inspiration. Women from across Zanzibar visit to learn how to cultivate Juncao, and Massawe welcomes them warmly. "Prepare your farms," she told them. "Come to me, and I will give you the seeds." As workers load bundles of Juncao onto her truck, Massawe dreams of expanding her dairy operation to meet Zanzibar's growing demand. The once-skeptical farmer has become a champion of change, and the green Juncao grass continues to transform lives across the islands, one farm at a time. "I hope our government strengthens cooperation with China on agricultural technologies like Juncao," she said. "China has given us great support." ■
