Feature: First Confucius Institute on Indonesia's Sumatra Island inaugurates-Xinhua PADANG, Indonesia, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Bathed in bright sunshine and swaying coconut shadows, the campus of Padang State University buzzed with excitement on Thursday as guests gathered to celebrate the inauguration of the first Confucius Institute on Indonesia's Sumatra Island - and the 10th in the country. Jointly established by Tianjin Foreign Studies University and Padang State University, the new institute is expected to bring fresh cultural vitality to Indonesia's second-largest island, home to more than one-fifth of the nation's population, while opening a new window for China-Indonesia people-to-people exchanges. "The establishment of the Confucius Institute holds great significance not only for our university but also for the entire Sumatra region," said Krismadinata, rector of Padang State University. "Through this platform, Indonesian students can systematically learn Chinese and understand Chinese culture, laying a foundation for their future development. This will not only improve the quality of Chinese education but also strengthen cultural and educational cooperation between our two countries," said Krismadinata Chen Wu, counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, described the inauguration as "a milestone in the history of educational exchanges between our two countries" and "a bridge that connects hearts through language." "China and Indonesia are friendly neighbors across the sea, and bilateral ties are now at their best in history," Chen said. "The Confucius Institute will help young Indonesians better understand a real China in a multidimensional and comprehensive manner, allowing different civilizations to shine through mutual learning and exchange." On the same day, a Center for Chinese Studies was also unveiled at Padang State University. Li Yingying, president of Tianjin Foreign Studies University, said education and cultural cooperation are vital bonds linking the hearts of the two peoples. "We hope the Confucius Institute will serve as a bridge between Chinese and Indonesian youth, fostering closer understanding through language and cultural exchange," she said. For Ganefri, co-director of the Confucius Institute at Padang State University, the unveiling marked the realization of a long-held dream. "I've been waiting for this moment for so long, and today it has finally come true," he said excitedly. He explained that the university currently offers around 50 Chinese classes each semester, with some 2,500 students studying the language. "However, we have long faced a shortage of qualified teachers," he said. "The Confucius Institute will help ease this challenge and create more job opportunities for students." As Chinese investment in Indonesia continues to grow, so does the demand for people proficient in Chinese. "This is a valuable opportunity for Indonesian students," Ganefri said. "The Confucius Institute not only promotes cultural exchange between our two countries but also helps both peoples understand each other better. Students can learn the language, experience Chinese culture, and at the same time introduce Indonesian culture to Chinese friends. It's a genuine exchange of civilizations," Ganefri added. "I really enjoy the sound and writing of Chinese," said Aldo Sonata, a Padang State University student taking Chinese classes. "With the Confucius Institute, our learning will be more systematic, and we can gain deeper insights into Chinese culture." He added that many of his classmates also study Chinese because "it has become a real advantage in finding a job." As Counselor Chen noted, "Language is the vehicle of civilization, and communication is the foundation of friendship." On Sumatra Island, the newly established Confucius Institute is not just a center for learning but also a bridge of friendship and understanding - one that connects young people in China and Indonesia and opens a new chapter in cultural exchange and mutual learning. ■
