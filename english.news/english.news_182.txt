Iraq announces seizure of 185 artifacts in Britain-Xinhua BAGHDAD, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Culture, Tourism, and Antiquities Ahmed Fakak al-Badrani announced on Monday the seizure of 185 Iraqi-origin artifacts in Britain, reaffirming the government's commitment to protecting its national heritage. The minister made the announcement during his address at the 8th Scientific Conference, titled "The Civilizational Role of the City of Baghdad Through the Ages," held in the Iraqi capital. He credited the Iraqi cultural attache in London for notifying the ministry of the seizure. "The Iraqi cultural attache in London formally informed the ministry about the seizure of the 185 artifacts. Archaeological experts subsequently confirmed their Iraqi origin," al-Badrani told the conference. The minister noted that a significant number of antiquities have been recovered under the current and previous Iraqi governments, highlighting sustained efforts to repatriate stolen items. The period following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq marked a catastrophic chapter for the nation's cultural heritage, as the ensuing security vacuum led to the massive and systematic looting of thousands of ancient artifacts, particularly from the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad and countless unprotected archaeological sites across the country. According to statistics from the Iraqi Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities, more than 40,000 artifacts smuggled abroad have been recovered since 2003, including more than 17,000 pieces recovered from the United States. ■
