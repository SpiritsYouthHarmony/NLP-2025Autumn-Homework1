Alonso diplomatic after angry scenes at end of Clasico-Xinhua MADRID, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso sought to avoid controversy after the Clasico against FC Barcelona on Sunday following clashes between players at the final whistle. The incidents followed remarks earlier in the week from Barcelona winger Lamine Yamal, who said Real Madrid "robbed games," and several players confronted the 18-year-old after Madrid's 2-1 win, with insults exchanged and pushing and shoving before order was restored. "It's football. A lot of things have happened in all the Clasicos, and they'll continue to happen because there's a lot of tension, but I see it as normal," Alonso said of the confrontation, which saw the referee show seven yellow cards. "What happened at the end was a moment, both on our part and on theirs, of how much we wanted to win. We shouldn't get scared as long as it's a healthy rivalry," the coach added. Alonso was also asked about Vinicius Jr.'s reaction after the winger showed anger when substituted, gesturing and voicing his frustration. "I'm taking away many positive things from the game and from Vini," he said. "We'll talk about that, of course. There are players with different personalities, but we'll talk about it." Barcelona assistant coach Marcus Sorg spoke to the press in place of suspended coach Hansi Flick. He said his side had "made more mistakes than we're used to," noting they struggled to create chances. "They were better than us, you have to accept that. Sometimes defenders are good, and you have to accept that," he said, while downplaying the post-match scenes. "Honestly, I didn't notice. I don't know who started it as there were a lot of people on the benches shouting. We have to focus on the game," he said. ■
