Venezuela condemns U.S. military exercises in Caribbean-Xinhua CARACAS, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government on Sunday condemned the U.S. military for conducting military exercises in the Caribbean, saying they constituted a provocation and a threat to the region. The Venezuelan government considered that the military exercises conducted between Oct. 26 and 30 were part of a colonial operation and violated the Charter of the United Nations and the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace, said a statement released by the government through social media. The South American nation made it clear that it will not be intimidated by "military exercises or war cries." Multiple U.S. warships have been recently deployed in the Caribbean. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has repeatedly condemned Washington's actions as an attempt to overthrow his government and expand its military influence in Latin America. ■
