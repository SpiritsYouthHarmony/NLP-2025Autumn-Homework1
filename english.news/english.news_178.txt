1 more UN staff member detained in Yemen: spokesperson-Xinhua UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Houthi de facto authorities in Yemen arbitrarily detained one more UN staff member on Monday, said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "This follows the detention of five of our coworkers in recent days, including two UN female colleagues, bringing the total number of detainees to at least 59," Dujarric said at a daily briefing, adding that some have been held for years. He reiterated the UN's strong condemnation of the continued arbitrary detentions by the Houthis. In a related development, Houthi security members entered several UN offices in Sanaa on Sunday and over the past few days, confiscating information technology and communications equipment and assets, said Dujarric. The United Nations continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release of all personnel from the world body, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations and diplomatic missions, said the spokesperson. "They must be respected and protected in accordance with applicable international law," he added. ■
