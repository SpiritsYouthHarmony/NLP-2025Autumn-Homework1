Myanmar's national electrification master plan aims to meet power demand by 2030-Xinhua YANGON, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is implementing its National Electrification Master Plan to meet the country's increasing electricity demand by 2030, state-owned daily The Global New Light of Myanmar reported on Tuesday. Under the plan, the renewable energy sector (excluding hydropower) is expected to generate about 2,000 megawatts (MW) from domestic sources by 2030, the report said, adding that with sufficient international support, electricity generation could increase to 3,070 MW.

As of September 2025, Myanmar's total electricity generation capacity stood at 6,357 MW, with hydropower contributing 51 percent, natural gas 40 percent, solar power 4 percent, coal 2 percent, and diesel 3 percent, it added. ■
