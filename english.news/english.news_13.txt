BRI Stories | Malaysia's mega rail project adheres to green development concept-Xinhua PAHANG, Oct. 26, 2025 (Xinhua) -- The East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), a mega rail project in Malaysia being built by the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), runs from Malaysia's largest transport hub, Port Klang, and travels across the peninsula to Kelantan state in northeastern Malaysia. The rail link is expected to greatly enhance connectivity and bring more balanced growth to the country by linking its less-developed region on the east coast to the economic heartland on the west coast upon its completion. Since the start of the construction, the ECRL project has adhered to the concept of green development throughout the entire project cycle. Currently, the construction progress of the ECRL project has exceeded 80 percent, and the project is expected to be officially opened in 2027. The ECRL has appointed local environmental officers to conduct daily patrols and track the movements of wildlife such as Malayan tapirs and wild boars. The project has designed more than 20 animal passages to safeguard wildlife migration. Noise barriers have been set up along the project to reduce the noise pollution to the surrounding environment and residents. Security officers conduct regular patrols jointly with environmental officers, regularly educating constructors on wildlife protection. Photographer: Cheng Yiheng Editor: Yu Yang■
