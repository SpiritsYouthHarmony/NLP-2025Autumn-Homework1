Chance for glory in David vs Goliath Copa del Rey ties-Xinhua MADRID, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Copa del Rey first round continues on Wednesday with five matches involving teams from La Liga all travelling to face lower league rivals. Elche makes a short trip to the region of Murcia to face UD Las Garres, an amateur side from a village of just over 7,000 inhabitants that plays in Spain's sixth tier in the 1,000 capacity Las Tejeras Stadium. Villarreal currently sits third in La Liga after winning away to Valencia on Sunday night, but Marcelino Garcia Toral's side will have a different challenge away to fifth-tier Ciudad de Lucena, from the province of Cordoba in the south of Spain. The 5,000-capacity Ciudad de Lucena Stadium will be packed to the rafters as the home side looks to pull off an unlikely surprise against a rival with a poor record in the annual knockout competition. Osasuna has to fly to Mallorca to face another amateur side, with CD Sant Jordi awaiting in its 1,500-capacity stadium. Osasuna is clear favorite, but the Sant Jordi players and fans will know the team from Pamplona has lost all of its away matches this season and travels after a surprise 3-2 defeat at home to Celta Vigo. Atletic Sant Just is one of the lesser-known sides from the city of Barcelona and plays at home to 2024 finalist Mallorca, although the fifth-tier side has a handicap as the game has been moved to nearby Hospitalet as its ground doesn't meet the requirements. Finally, Rayo Vallecano makes the short trip from Madrid to the province of Toledo to face CD Yuncos, a sixth-tier side that represents a town of just over 10,000 inhabitants. ■
