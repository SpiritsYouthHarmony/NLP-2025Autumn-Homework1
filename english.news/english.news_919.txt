Interview: "Two sessions" key to observing China's governance, modernization, says Nigerian media executive-Xinhua by Olatunji Saliu ABUJA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's "two sessions" have become a crucial window through which the world observes the country's governance model and gains insights into the Chinese modernization, a Nigerian media executive has said. The "two sessions" showcase the transparency and efficiency of China's governance, as well as its responsible administrative system, Ali Muhammad Ali, managing director and CEO of the News Agency of Nigeria, told Xinhua. China's governance experience is even more valuable in the current context of profound global changes, he added. Having visited China multiple times, Ali has been deeply impressed by the country's rapid development and transformation. China stands out in renewable energy, infrastructure and agriculture, among other fields, he said. Describing China's engagement with other developing countries as "unique," he emphasized its focus on delivering tangible benefits through infrastructure development, vocational training and technology-driven investment. China's cooperation with African nations, particularly in industrialization, capacity building and technology transfer, is playing a crucial role in addressing the continent's development challenges, he said. "Africa is benefiting from industrial investments and infrastructure projects that are transforming economies across the continent," Ali said, adding that without roads, bridges, railways and power projects, "industrialization would be impossible." Noting that his news agency is keenly watching and reporting on this year's "two sessions," Ali expected the "two sessions" to reveal more information on future China-Africa cooperation. By deepening China-Africa cooperation, more African nations will learn from China's experience and jointly advance global governance and economic prosperity, he said. ■
