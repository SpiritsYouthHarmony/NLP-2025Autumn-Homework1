Feature: Marathon journey of 74-year-old "one-armed grandpa"-Xinhua TIANJIN, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- At 5 a.m., as the streetlights along the Haihe River in north China's Tianjin still flickered, 74-year-old Liu Runlong had already laced up his running shoes and begun his warm-up routine. Gently swinging his mutilated right arm, he set off along the familiar riverside path. Bridges reflected on the water as the city slowly woke to the rhythm of his footsteps. For Liu, the "one-armed grandpa" in Tianjin, mornings like this have been part of his life for more than four decades. "I ran my first marathon in 1981, during Tianjin's very first marathon," Liu recalled. "Back then, we didn't have professional gear, just a pair of sneakers and a bottle of water. I remember finishing ninth, with blisters all over my feet, but I was happier than ever." The running conditions were tough, he said, but that only made the first marathon more memorable. "When I crossed the finish line, what I felt wasn't exhaustion, but the burning power of life itself," Liu said. That passion was the starting line of Liu's marathon journey. Since then, running has never left his life. In 1996, an accident cost him his right hand, plunging him into a difficult period. But running helped him rebuild his life. "I could forget my pain only when I ran," he said. Determined to recover, Liu began training every morning, developing his own methods and seeking advice from professional athletes and coaches. "Running pulled me out of my darkest days," he said. Rain or shine, summer or winter, he has kept up his training. On tiring days, he switches to slow runs instead of taking full rest, keeping his routine unbroken. In 2011, Liu and a group of running enthusiasts founded the "Ziya River Running Club," where he became a coach. Today, the club has grown to more than 400 members. "We meet by the riverside every day to train, and I have never missed a day," he said. "Many runners tell me that running has made them more confident and optimistic." Among local runners, the "one-armed grandpa" is seen not only as a leader but also as an inspiration. This year, at the age of 74, Liu again completed the Tianjin Marathon, finishing in 4 hours and 39 minutes. "Race day is actually the easiest day," he said with a laugh. "The whole city opens its roads for you. No matter how fast or slow you go, there's always someone running beside you. It's an incredible feeling." To him, marathon running is more than just a sport. "Running a marathon is like living a life," he said. "You start full of energy then face cramps, pain, exhaustion, just like the hardships in life. But as long as you have faith and keep going, the finishing line will always appear." "Running keeps me young," he said. "Every race is a new beginning. The finish line is never the end, it's just the start of another journey." Now, his apartment is filled with medals, certificates and race bibs, which are not only awards but also chapters of his life story. Running for 44 years, he has witnessed the evolution of the Tianjin Marathon, and of the city itself. Tianjin was among the first Chinese cities to host marathon events. The inaugural race in 1981 drew only 165 participants. This year, 33,000 runners from across the globe competed in the Tianjin Marathon, turning the event into a symbol of the city's growing sports culture. "When I was young, Tianjin's buildings were low, and the streets were unadorned. Now the city has become modern, vibrant, and the marathon routes are beautiful with clean, green scenery," Liu said. Even after 44 years, Liu's marathon hasn't ended. He said that as long as there is passion, the road will always stretch ahead. ■
