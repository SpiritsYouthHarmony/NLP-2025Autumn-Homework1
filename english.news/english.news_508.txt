Brazil's methanol poisoning death toll rises to 9-Xinhua SAO PAULO, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from methanol-tainted distilled beverages in Brazil has risen to nine, with another seven deaths still under investigation, the Health Ministry said Monday. The adulteration of distilled drinks such as gin, vodka and whiskey with methanol, an alcohol unfit for human consumption, occurred in September at bars and distributors across several regions, mainly in the southeastern state of Sao Paulo. Police have since launched operations to seize bottles and labels from illicit warehouses. Two more deaths were confirmed compared with last week. According to the ministry, six victims died in Sao Paulo, two in the northeastern state of Pernambuco, and one in Parana in the south. Sao Paulo continues to report the highest number of cases, with 38 confirmed and 19 under investigation. ■
