Zimbabwe vows to enhance partnership on migration for sustainable development-Xinhua HARARE, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government on Monday expressed its readiness to continue working with multiple partners on migration issues for sustainable development within the southern African region. Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage Kazembe Kazembe made the remarks while officially opening the eighth Migration Dialogue for Southern Africa (MIDSA) in Zimbabwe's resort town of Victoria Falls, saying migration is a powerful driver of regional integration, economic growth and cultural exchange. Kazembe said Zimbabwe will work with other Southern African Development Community member states, the African Union, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the International Labor Organization to ensure that migration remains a force for shared prosperity, human development and regional unity. "The future of our region depends on our ability to harness migration for sustainable development, climate resilience, women and youth empowerment," he said. Noting the growing impact of climate change on migration in the region, Kazembe called for policies that address the nexus between climate change, migration and development. "We must strengthen early warning systems, build climate-resilient economies and promote adaptive livelihood strategies that allow communities to thrive in their home regions," he said. Kazembe also called for migration policies that harness the potential of young people on the continent through increased job creation, investment in skills development and facilitation of legal mobility channels that allow them to study, innovate and engage in productive enterprises across regional borders. Jointly organized by the Zimbabwean government, the IOM and the United Nations Children's Fund, the 2025 MIDSA gathered government representatives, policymakers and experts to foster regional cooperation on migration governance, dialogue and the exchange of best practices. ■
