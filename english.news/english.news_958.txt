Remembering the shared fight: Chinese and Koreans against Japanese aggression-Xinhua From 1910 to 1945, the Korean Peninsula was under Imperial Japan's colonization. Many independence activists in the peninsula went into exile in China. There, they established many resistance groups against Japanese aggression and fought side by side with Chinese troops against the Japanese invaders, ultimately contributing to the great victory in the World Anti-Fascist War. The profound friendship between the peoples of China and South Korea, forged during the joint fight, has endured ever since. On the 80th anniversary of the victory, Xinhuanet sat down with Lee Myung-hwa, director of the Institute of Korean Independence Movement Studies at the Independence Hall of Korea. Lee reflected on the joint struggles of patriots from both sides and shared her insights on promoting peace among the younger generation through various exchange programs.
