Over 120 killed in floods across Niger, says UN spokesperson-Xinhua UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 people have been killed due to deadly floods across Niger this year, a UN spokesperson said Thursday. Authorities in Niger said that the flooding during this year's rainy season, which generally begins in June, has affected some 550,000 people, with the regions of Dosso, Tillaberi and Maradi worst affected, Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, told reporters at a daily briefing. The floods have also destroyed nearly 55,000 houses and left over 10,000 acres of farmland underwater, Haq said, citing the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The United Nations and its humanitarian partners are working to support government-led relief efforts in Niger, but resources remain extremely limited, with this year's response plan for Niger totalling 603 million U.S. dollars and less than a fifth funded, he said. ■
