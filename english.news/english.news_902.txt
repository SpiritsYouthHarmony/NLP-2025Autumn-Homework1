G20 women's empowerment meeting kicks off in South Africa to finalize landmark declaration-Xinhua JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- The G20 Empowerment of Women Working Group on Monday convened its fourth technical meeting in Ekurhuleni, South Africa's Gauteng Province, with a call for efforts to reach a ministerial declaration. Addressing participants, Mikateko Maluleke, chairperson of the G20 Empowerment of Women Working Group, said the meeting seeks to conclude negotiations on the Empowerment of Women Ministerial Declaration, which is expected to be adopted by ministers on Oct. 31. "This is critical not only for all women in the G20 countries, but for all women in the Global South and Global North. We have all been engaging in the three versions of the ministerial declaration, through your robust engagements," said Maluleke. The chairperson stressed that reaching the agreement would "translate the hard work, dedication, and compromises reached by all delegations from its conception in India in 2023." Maluleke added that while significant progress had been made in the negotiations over the past three months, further efforts were still needed to finalize the declaration. The fourth and final G20 Empowerment of Women Working Group Technical and Ministerial Meeting will run through Friday, featuring delegates from G20 member states, guest nations, and international organizations. ■
