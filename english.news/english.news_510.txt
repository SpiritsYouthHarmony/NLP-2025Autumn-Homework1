Mexican president says over 2,000 Mexicans arrested in U.S. since January-Xinhua MEXICO CITY, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday said 2,382 Mexicans have been taken into custody in the United States since January this year. During her morning press conference at the National Palace, Sheinbaum noted that 1,390 Mexicans, or around 58.3 percent of the total detainees, were arrested between June 6 and Oct. 20 in the immigration crackdowns carried out by the U.S. government. Sheinbaum expressed concern about the legal status of those detained, which has not been fully clarified. "We disagree with the way our brothers and sisters are being treated there," the president said, referring to the immigration raids in the United States. Mexico, she reiterated, has sent Washington several diplomatic notes regarding its new anti-immigrant policy and is assisting citizens who require legal advice to denounce human rights violations. Sheinbaum stressed that the victims themselves must file corresponding complaints for consular support and further legal assistance. ■
