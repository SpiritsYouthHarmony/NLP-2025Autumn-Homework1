China passes its newly revised Maritime Law-Xinhua BEIJING, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature on Tuesday passed the country's newly revised Maritime Law, which will take effect on May 1, 2026. The revised law was approved at the 18th session of the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Spanning 16 chapters and featuring 310 articles, it adapts to the latest trends in shipping and trade, draws on the latest international maritime conventions, and balances the interests of relevant parties. It holds significance for promoting high-quality development in shipping and trade, enhancing marine environmental protection, advancing high-level opening up, and building China into both a maritime power and a shipping power.
