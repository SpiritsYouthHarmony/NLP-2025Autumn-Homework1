Month-long indigenous protests over diesel subsidy removal end in Ecuador-Xinhua QUITO, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) on Wednesday announced an end to protests over the government's decision to remove a diesel subsidy. The protests were launched about a month ago and mainly staged in the northern Andean province of Imbabura, which led to violent clashes with law enforcement officers, causing casualties on both sides, including three deaths, official data showed. In a social media post, Conaie said, "We have taken a difficult but necessary decision: to end the 2025 National Strike, clear the roads and retreat to our territories to protect the lives of our people." The Ecuadorian government adopted a decree to cancel the diesel subsidy on Sept. 12, prompting a fuel price hike from 1.80 to 2.80 U.S. dollars per gallon. Eliminating the diesel subsidy has been widely opposed by Ecuador's various social sectors, transport workers and unions, who fear that it will increase the cost of living. The decision sparked a wave of street demonstrations in several provinces in the South American country. Hours before the Conaie announcement, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa warned in a radio interview that by Thursday, his government would move to dismantle the roadblocks in Imbabura province. Noboa also announced an economic recovery program targeting Imbabura, areas in the north of Pichincha province, where the capital Quito is located, and Carchi province. ■
