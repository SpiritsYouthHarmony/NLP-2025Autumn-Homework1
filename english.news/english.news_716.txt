U.S. consumer sentiment falls slightly in October: survey-Xinhua NEW YORK, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Consumer Sentiment Index released Friday by the University of Michigan (UM) Surveys of Consumers fell to 53.6 in the October 2025 survey, down from 55.1 in September and below last October's 70.5. The Current Economic Conditions Index fell to 58.6, down from 60.4 in September and below last October's 64.9. The Index of Consumer Expectations fell to 50.3, down from 51.7 in September and below last October's 74.1. Consumers remain frustrated by the persistence of high prices. About 45 percent of consumers referenced that their personal finances were eroded by high prices, the highest reading since August 2024. A modest increase in sentiment among younger consumers was offset by decreases among middle-aged and older consumers. Current personal finances inched up, while expected personal finances receded, said economist Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys. Overall, consumers see few material changes in economic circumstances from last month, as inflation and high prices remain at the forefront of consumers' minds, she said. ■
