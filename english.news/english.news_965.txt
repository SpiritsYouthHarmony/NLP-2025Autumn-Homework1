From Iran to China: A medical student’s Silk Road dream-Xinhua Parvin Esmaeili-Andehkordi, who goes by Pan Meng in China, is originally from Iran and is currently pursuing her graduate studies in general surgery at Xi’an Jiaotong University. Since arriving in China in 2019, her journey in medicine has closely followed the path of the Belt and Road Initiative. “Becoming a doctor has been my lifelong dream,” she shares. Inspired by her father, a surgeon, and her mother, a nurse, Pan Meng has always been passionate about medicine. At the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University, she has had the opportunity to learn advanced hepatobiliary surgical techniques and expand her expertise through international academic exchanges. “My hope is to foster medical collaboration across countries, so that more people can access high-quality healthcare,” she says. Looking ahead, Pan Meng aspires to bring the knowledge and skills she has gained in China back to her hometown, where she plans to open a hospital with her father. Through this, she aims to strengthen medical cooperation between Iran and China, benefiting even more patients.
