Real Madrid defender Carvajal out for around two months with knee injury-Xinhua MADRID, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid's 2-1 win over FC Barcelona has come at a price with the club informing on Monday morning that defender Dani Carvajal has suffered an important knee injury. "Following tests carried out on our captain Dani Carvajal by the Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with the presence of a loose body in his right knee joint," reported the Real Madrid official website, adding the defender would "now undergo an arthroscopy." The injury is likely to sideline the defender until the start of 2026. The new injury setback comes after the Spain international returned to action as a second half substitute against Barcelona after missing a month with a muscle injury. The 33-year-old missed nearly all the 2024-25 season with a torn knee ligament, only returning to the field at the start of the current campaign to compete with new arrival Trent Alexander-Arnold for the right back spot in Xabi Alonso's side. Alexander-Arnold has also just returned from a muscle injury, with Alonso using Uruguayan midfielder Fede Valverde on the right of his side's defense. ■
