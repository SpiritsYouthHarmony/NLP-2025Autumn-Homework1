Chinese-built bridge achieves full structural connection in Tanzania-Xinhua DAR ES SALAAM, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- The final beam of one of Tanzania's longest heavy-load railway bridges, the Malagarasi River Bridge, has been successfully installed, marking a significant milestone in the country's central standard gauge railway (SGR) project, officials said on Tuesday. Constructed by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, the 433.5-meter bridge serves as a vital link in section six of the SGR, connecting Tanzania's eastern and western regions, according to project engineers. The Chinese company said in a statement that the installation of the final 24-meter pre-cast I-beam, which completes the bridge's main structure, paves the way for deck construction and subsequent track laying. A total of 68 beams were installed under demanding conditions, including frequent flooding and complex geological terrain, the statement said, adding that advanced construction methods and strict safety standards ensured "zero accidents and zero deviations" throughout the operation. The Malagarasi Bridge, the only crossing over a perennial river along its section, is regarded as a key control project due to its technical complexity and strategic importance. Once operational, the bridge is expected to cut logistics costs, boost freight capacity, and stimulate industrial and trade growth along the corridor, the statement added. ■
