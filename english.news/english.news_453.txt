China's central bank to resume treasury bond purchases in open market-Xinhua BEIJING, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank will resume treasury bond purchases in the open market, Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People's Bank of China, said at the Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum 2025 on Monday. Pan said the decision follows a suspension earlier this year due to supply and demand imbalances and market risk accumulation. Considering the bond market is operating well as a whole at present, the central bank will resume open-market treasury bond trading operations, Pan said. ■
