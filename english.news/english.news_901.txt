Reliability, affordability boost Sinotruk's popularity in Kenya: dealer-Xinhua NAIROBI, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- The reliability and affordability of vehicles produced by China's heavy-duty truck maker Sinotruk have boosted their growing popularity in the Kenyan market, industry leaders said on Monday. Hossein Goudarzi, chief executive officer of Printan, a local motor dealer and the official distributor of Sinotruk, told journalists in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, that the Chinese commercial vehicles have been engineered to perform well across Africa's toughest terrains and workloads. "Sinotruk vehicles stand out in Kenya's transport and construction sectors because of the availability of reliable after-sales service and access to genuine spare parts locally," Goudarzi said during the handover of 10 Sinotruk HOWO concrete mixers to Landmark Holdings, a construction and civil engineering company based in Kenya. Harveer Singh Sethi, chief executive officer of Landmark Holdings, noted that their research on all commercial trucks available in Kenya indicates that Sinotruk outperforms all other brands in terms of total cost of ownership. Sethi added that the growing preference for Sinotruk vehicles underscores a broader trend of Chinese-made vehicles playing a critical role in supporting Kenya's industrialization and infrastructure development. ■
