Mbappe, Bellingham power Real Madrid past FC Barcelona-Xinhua MADRID, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham scored in the first half as Real Madrid beat FC Barcelona 2-1 at home in the first Clasico of the season on Sunday. The win moves Real Madrid five points clear at the top of the table, and, as in many recent meetings between the teams, there were contentious moments. There was early drama when Real Madrid was awarded a second-minute penalty after Vinicius Jr went down under a challenge from Lamine Yamal, but the decision was overturned after a VAR check. Mbappe then drove a 25-meter shot into the Barcelona net, only for the goal to be ruled out for a tight offside. He opened the scoring in the 22nd minute from a Bellingham assist. Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny saved well from Dean Huijsen's header and was called into action again by Vinicius. The Barcelona front line of Ferran Torres, Marcus Rashford and Yamal saw little of the ball, but Fermin Lopez leveled against the run of play in the 38th minute, angling in Rashford's low pass. Bellingham turned in Eder Militao's looping header from close range five minutes later, although Barcelona argued the goal should have been disallowed after Huijsen caught Pau Cubarsi with an elbow in the buildup. Despite a VAR check, the goal stood. Real Madrid had a chance to make it 3-1 early in the second half when Eric Garcia was penalized for handball, but Mbappe's penalty was saved by Szczesny. As the match progressed, Real Madrid sat deeper and limited Barcelona's counterattacks as Yamal tried to influence the game. Jules Kounde had a chance for Barcelona but miscontrolled with his chest, and the visitors' night worsened in stoppage time when Pedri was sent off for a second yellow card. ■
