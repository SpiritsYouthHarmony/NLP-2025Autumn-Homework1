Over half of women in Germany feel unsafe in public spaces:survey-Xinhua BERLIN, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- More than half of women in Germany feel unsafe in public spaces, according to a survey reported Tuesday by the German news agency dpa. The survey, conducted by polling institute Civey among 5,000 adults aged 18 and older, found that 55 percent of women said they felt unsafe in all the public locations surveyed - including streets, public transport, parks, clubs, and train stations. Nightclubs and train stations were viewed as the least safe places, with only 14 percent of female respondents saying they felt secure there. Across all participants, including men, 49 percent said they did not feel safe in any of the locations mentioned. The findings come amid a rise in gender-based violence across Germany. According to the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), crimes directed against women have continued to increase in recent years. In its latest report on gender-specific crimes, the BKA recorded 322 bias-motivated crimes against women in 2023, marking a 56.3 percent increase compared with the previous year. Within this category, 29 misogynistic violent offenses were documented, nearly double the figure from 2022. ■
