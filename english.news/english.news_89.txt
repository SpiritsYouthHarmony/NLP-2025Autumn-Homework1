Cambodia hosts regional seminar on mine action in Lancang-Mekong countries-Xinhua SIEM REAP, Cambodia, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia hosted here on Tuesday a regional seminar on mine action in the Lancang-Mekong countries. Ly Thuch, first vice president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, said the seminar was attended by mine officials and experts from Cambodia, China, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. "Decades of armed conflict have left our lands contaminated, our people endangered, and our development restrained," he said in an opening speech. Thuch said Cambodia, like many of its neighbors, has walked a long and difficult road. "With the support of international partners, the dedication of our deminers, and the resilience of our people, we have cleared millions of square meters of land, reduced casualties, and restored life to once-dangerous places," he said. Thuch said the regional gathering reflected a shared mission to free the region from the deadly legacy of landmines and explosive remnants of war. "This regional seminar on mine action under the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation marks a significant step forward in our collective journey," he said. "It is a platform not only for exchanging knowledge and best practices, but for deepening our bonds of solidarity." Thuch expressed gratitude to China for supporting mine action in the region and helping to provide a meaningful platform to strengthen cooperation and share experiences among the Lancang-Mekong countries. Speaking of Cambodia in particular, he said China has played an important role in supporting Cambodia's mine action efforts, helping to bring safety to the Cambodian people and transform former minefields into lands of hope and opportunity. ■
