Philippines lifts ban on birds, poultry imports from Argentina, Romania, Turkiye-Xinhua MANILA, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has lifted its temporary import ban on wild and domestic birds from Argentina, Romania, and Turkiye, following the containment of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in those countries, the country's Department of Agriculture said Tuesday. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel issued separate memorandum orders authorizing the resumption of imports, citing the absence of new outbreaks and official clearance from the World Organization for Animal Health. The temporary import ban had been imposed as a precaution to protect the Philippines' local poultry industry from the spread of bird flu. The Department of Agriculture said the decision to lift the import bans was based on risk assessments conducted by the agency's Bureau of Animal Industry. Citing the bureau's assessment, Tiu Laurel said the risk of contamination from importing poultry meat, live birds, day-old chicks, and poultry semen from these countries is now considered "negligible." He said lifting the ban is a move seen as both strategic and necessary. "With poultry playing a critical role in ensuring national food security -- and contributing significantly to employment and agribusiness -- reopening safe import channels is essential for stabilizing supply and keeping prices in check," he added. Diversifying import sources also buffers the country against future supply shocks, especially as global food chains remain vulnerable to disease outbreaks and geopolitical tensions, he said. According to Tiu Laurel, the DA's move underscores a balancing act: protecting local producers while ensuring Filipino consumers continue to have access to affordable, safe, and sufficient poultry products. ■
