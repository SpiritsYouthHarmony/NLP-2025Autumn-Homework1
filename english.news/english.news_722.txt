The cafe, inspired by the Chinese animated series "Heaven Official's Blessing" and its popular online novel, features menus, decor, and merchandise that mirror the story's world. On opening day, around 150 to 200 fans waited for hours as the line wrapped around the corner and onto the next block. "It's really cool, really cute. I've never been to an event like this before. I've only gone to (anime) conventions, so this feels like a completely different environment. They should do more of these," Blake Miller, a fan of "Heaven Official's Blessing," told Xinhua. For Miller, 23, the trip was not easy. He traveled for four and a half hours after hearing about the opening just the day before, canceling all his other plans to be there. "It was worth it," he said. Miller said that it was one of the first animated series he had ever followed. After seeing artwork related to the story, he read the novel and became captivated by one of the main characters. "The storytelling was what really pulled me in," he said. Then, he got into the series when the initial season of the animation was released. "It was starting to get really hyped at that time, so I got into it right at the peak moment, which was really cool," he said. What appeals to him most about the animation, Miller added, is seeing the characters in traditional Chinese clothing, something he finds "different." Jen Dunn, 35, from Queens, stood out in the crowd at the cafe's opening, wearing a Hanfu outfit she had sewn herself. For her, making the traditional Chinese garment was not just a creative project but also a way to connect more deeply with the culture portrayed in the animated series. "I really like these kinds of pop-ups. The decorations are always beautiful, and the way they put everything together is impressive," she told Xinhua. "The donghua (animation) always look really nice. It's hard to compare across cultures, but they are very, very good-looking." Dunn said she watches a wide range of animation but has recently been seeking out more Chinese productions. "I'm trying to get into more Chinese animation, whatever I can find translated," she said. In recent years, she has noticed that more Chinese works are not only streaming online but also being released on the big screen. "A lot of the movies are really good, like 'Nezha,'" she said, citing the box-office hit, which has just been released with English dubbing as an example. Her growing interest in Chinese animation has gradually led her to explore Chinese culture more broadly. Costumes such as those worn in "Heaven Official's Blessing," with their distinctive gufeng, or ancient-style aesthetics, especially inspire her. "I quite like the clothing for each episode. They are very pretty," she said. "When I tried sewing Hanfu, I did a lot of research," she added. "It was both a learning process and a way to appreciate the traditions behind the clothing." Shani Polyakov, 16, from Israel, is spending the summer in Staten Island, New York City. She traveled nearly two hours to the opening of the pop-up cafe. "I've been a fan of anime for a long time. I saw a famous TikTok about the cafe and decided to come," she said. "I don't watch much Chinese animation, but I think it's beautiful and very well written. The storytelling is really good." For Polyakov, visiting the cafe was a way to experience the world of "Heaven Official's Blessing" in person and to pick up some exclusive merchandise. Beyond the cafe, she said she has enjoyed exploring Flushing, which is home to one of the fastest-growing Chinese communities in New York. "By opening here, we hope to bring original Chinese animation to a wider international audience," Qiao Yuzhen, the project director of Dimension Poptown and the pop-up cafe project, told Xinhua. The cafe follows earlier pop-ups in Southeast Asia and marks the project's first debut in North America. While Asia remains the heartland of anime culture, Qiao said the global response has been remarkable. "These works combine the modern storytelling of online novels with traditional elements like gufeng aesthetic and Hanfu costumes, and that mix resonates strongly overseas," Qiao said. The decision to feature "Heaven Official's Blessing" came after conducting audience research and reflected the series' adaptability to the international market. "Chinese animation is gaining recognition abroad," Qiao said. "Titles like 'Heaven Official's Blessing' and 'Link Click' (another Chinese animation series) stand out for their storytelling and visual style, and they represent the strength of Chinese animation today." Qiao said Dimension Poptown plans to expand its partnerships with both Chinese and international IP holders as well as local businesses. Its initiatives range from collaborating on domestic animations, novels and games to working with global franchises in order to share Chinese culture with wider audiences overseas. "These Chinese stories and visuals can appeal to audiences worldwide," she said. ■ Jen Dunn, a fan of Chinese animation, poses in front of the newly-opened Chinese animation-themed cafe in New York, the United States, Aug. 26, 2025.
