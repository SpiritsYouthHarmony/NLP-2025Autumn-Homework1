In the audience, guests from Indonesia and abroad raised their cameras, capturing every detail of the sophisticated ensembles that define the country's growing modest fashion industry. Featuring more than 1,650 creations by 214 Indonesian designers and 11 international ones, the 2025 Indonesia International Modest Fashion Festival was held from Oct. 8 to 12 at JIEXPO Jakarta. The annual event was complemented by a series of programs, including seminars, business matching sessions, and international market forums aimed at promoting collaboration and innovation in the modest fashion sector. Opening the festival, Batik Widayati presented 24 pieces under the theme "Blossom as You Are," using eco-friendly natural dyes. The collection featured blouses, skirts, blazers, dresses, and vests adorned with "tropical garden" motifs combined with batik truntum patterns from the royal palace of Solo, Central Java, symbolizing harmony, love, and women's resilience. "I want women to be beautiful in their own way, like flowers in a vertical garden that grow even in limited space," said Wiwiek Widayati, owner of Batik Widayati, in an interview with Xinhua after the opening show. Wiwiek's journey into fashion began after she was laid off from her banking job in 2018. Turning to batik as a form of healing, she found a new purpose in creative expression. "Since then, I've devoted myself to using canting and sketching batik designs, and that's how Batik Widayati was born," she said. With strong institutional support, including training from national designers, her 400-piece collection now sells out at exhibitions. Dubai-based designer and psychologist Sheida Fadaei showcased eight abaya designs inspired by the psychology of color, form, and texture. "Every abaya I make carries a story and psychological meaning. I want women to feel confident and energized when they wear it," she told Xinhua. For Sheida, modest fashion represents more than just covered clothing -- it is a form of emotional and spiritual expression. She recalled how one of her clients, struggling with depression, regained confidence after wearing one of her designs. "That's my goal: to help women find strength through clothing," she said. Sheida also expressed plans to collaborate with designers from Thailand, Australia, and Türkiye, incorporating local cultural symbols, such as kangaroo motifs from Australia, into her future abaya collections to promote cross-cultural friendship. Indonesia's Minister of Tourism Widiyanti Putri said that modest fashion not only supports economic growth but also enhances the nation's tourism image. "Indonesia has extraordinary cultural heritage and creativity, including in the modest fashion industry," Widiyanti said. Lenny Agustin, National Chairperson of the Indonesia Fashion Chamber, noted that the modest fashion market continues to expand both domestically and internationally. With a population of over 280 million, Indonesia offers vast potential for the industry. "The market now isn't limited to women wearing hijab," Lenny said. "Many people choose layered clothing because it's comfortable, elegant, and suitable for various occasions." To strengthen global outreach, Indonesia has also launched initiatives such as the annual Front Row Paris fashion showcase in France, fully organized by Indonesian stakeholders. "Every year, more European buyers come to see it," Lenny said. With growing creativity among designers and increasing institutional support, industry players remain optimistic about Indonesia's modest fashion prospects on the global stage. ■ A model presents a creation of Batik Martadireja during the 2025 Indonesia International Modest Fashion Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia, Oct. 9, 2025.
