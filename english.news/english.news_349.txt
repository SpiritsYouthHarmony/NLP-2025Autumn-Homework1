In the first 11 months of last year, China's non-financial direct investment in BRI countries totaled 214.66 billion yuan, and investment in China from those countries climbed to 99.87 billion yuan. China signed 36 investment cooperation agreements with BRI countries from January to November last year, mainly involving emerging fields such as the green, digital and blue economies, Li said. She noted that in the first 11 months of 2024, China's contracted projects in BRI partner countries saw a turnover of 826.34 billion yuan, and China organized and implemented 700 aid projects in those countries, helping to improve their development. ■
