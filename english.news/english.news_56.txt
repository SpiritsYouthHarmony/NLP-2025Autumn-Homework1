Mexico, U.S. agree to extend tariff deadline-Xinhua MEXICO CITY, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that her U.S. counterpart Donald Trump agreed to postpone tariffs on Mexican exports previously scheduled to take effect on Nov. 1. Trump threatened in July to increase tariffs on some Mexican goods from 25 percent to 30 percent, but gave the country a 90-day reprieve, set to expire on Nov. 1, to negotiate with the U.S. side. During their talks Saturday, they agreed to allow "a few more weeks" to address U.S. demands for Mexico to remove 54 non-tariff barriers, said Sheinbaum at her daily press conference. "We're practically closing this issue," she said. Since taking office in January, Trump has pursued a trade policy focused on imposing tariffs on partners he considers treating the United States unfairly, including tariffs on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper. ■
