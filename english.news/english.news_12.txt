Russia test-flies second MC-21 jet prototype with domestic parts-Xinhua MOSCOW, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- The second prototype of Russia's MC-21 medium-haul aircraft with home-made components has completed a test flight, the Russian Industry and Trade Ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry said the flight tested the operation of new domestic systems and PD-14 engines. The plane took off from the airfield of the Irkutsk Aviation Plant of Yakovlev company, part of Russia's state-owned aviation giant Rostec, it said, adding that it flew for 50 minutes, reaching an altitude of up to 3,500 meters. "The aircraft will join the certification testing program along with the MC-21 prototype partially equipped with new Russian systems and units, which made its first flight in its new form on April 29, 2025," the ministry said. Certification of the import-substituted MC-21 aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said earlier. According to the Yakovlev website, the MC-21 has a capacity of up to 211 seats, with a maximum range of 3,830 km. The MC-21 project started out as international, but it later turned to the substitution of imported systems and components due to sanctions. ■
