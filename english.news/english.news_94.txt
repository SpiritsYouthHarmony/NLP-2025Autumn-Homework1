Vasco cruises as Vegetti nets twice-Xinhua RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Pablo Vegetti scored twice as Vasco da Gama cruised to a 3-0 away win over Bragantino in Brazil's Serie A on Sunday. The visitors took the lead just before the half hour when Vegetti volleyed home after Lucas Piton's cross from the left flank. Argentine striker Vegetti doubled the advantage in the 69th minute, pouncing on a loose ball to fire in from close range. Forward Gabriel Silva put the result beyond doubt as he combined with Andres Gomez to finish off a swift attacking move by smashing a left-footed effort into the roof of the net. "I haven't been in the best form but the most important thing is that we've been winning," Vegetti said after the match. "I feel like an important part of the squad, both on and off the pitch and this shows what can happen when you don't bow your head." The result leaves Vasco eighth in the Serie A standings with 42 points, six ahead of 12th-placed Bragantino. ■
